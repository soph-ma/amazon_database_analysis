 review/text: For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product.

 review/summary: Protects for a few bucks, but you can find better
 review/text: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).

 review/summary: Not sure what the complaints are about
 review/text: I just upgraded to this Motorola Razr. Like most of you, when this came out I really, really wanted one, but they were just too pricey. Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy. I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The "flat" buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit. I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me. The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem. If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option. I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two. The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect? Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said: If you want a decent camera get a decent camera. If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA. If you want an iPod get an iPod. This is a very good phone with lots of extra features, but it's not perfect. Personally, I don't think the perfect phone exists -- yet.

 review/text: I definitely like the phone for it's slender design and features. the only thing that gets me is getting used to actually using the phone. trying to make sense of call history, or to quickly access some of your items can be trying for someone who is not as tech savvy with cell phones. i enjoy the phone and it does what it supposed to do very well... make and receive calls!clear audio quality, no dropped calls so far and a HUGE screen to see things. after reading the guide and sitting down with the phone for an hour or two and re-programming it,... it's a lot more user-friendly. it's as good as any other phone for text msgs.good battery life and if looking for accessories, definitely look for a snug holster to avoid this phone from feeling loose in its case. You can also find good accessories at Radioshack.

But I just changed the frequency to 88.3 and it worked perfectly again. I really like this product, especially because I had the Griffin iTrip before and that thing sucked on all levels. The only problem I have with this product is that it does not charge th iPod like others do, but I can deal with that.

 review/summary: Warning: phone not for dummies
 review/text: Update to the review below: I forgot to mention how poor my reception is. At the time of the review I figured it was just TMobile's fault, but no...its the T610. I've verified this by noticing other people's cell phones (TMobile and others) working perfectly fine in my apartment while I need to stand immediatly beside the window to have a conversation. BUT, this is the best part, this is one issue that can be remedied with something I found quite by accident. Upon googling the phrase "coolest thing ever" I was delighted to see as about the fourth result on the list an article about a program you can download and install to your computer and T610 (among other Bluetooth phones)which will turn your Bluetooth phone into a remote control for your computer. Besides enabling you to control many popular media players and other programs on your computer with your phone, you can sit the phone in an area with reception and then make your calls using your computer mic/headset. If you own the T610 or any other Bluetooth phone you should really check this out. I can't stress enough how cool this is. Hence it being among the top 5 results upon a web search of "coolest thing ever."Now back to my earlier review:I think many of the bad reviews here are unfair. I've owned this phone for about 14 months. Many of the problems these people have had are either faults of T-Mobile or the user themselves didn't configure the phone correctly.Rule #1 - when you buy stuff like this phone, READ THE MANUAL ON HOW TO CONFIGURE IT! Seems simple enough to me.As far as the phone dropping calls, that has only happened to me when on long calls (I mean like 2 or 4 hour calls and when it drops the call its usually right at 2 hours or 4 hours, so i assume its a network preserving thing of T-Mobile. And i can live with that...just call them back). Plus, I'm under the impression that T-Mobile uses a weak signal, at least where i live, and this is certainly to blame for the weak reception. It does seem like when i get a connection that the phone tries to maintain it even when moving into weaker areas where i wouldn't have been able to initiate the call.The problems with people looking at the phone to discover they are in a menu already has to do with the shortcut functions and the key-lock. The key-lock is the same as almost all other phones (press a function key followed by the * key, repeat to unlock). The shortcut function is more complicated. Some Nokias have something similar....you can tell this phone that when I press these 2 keys I want to do a specific function that would normally require several key strokes. There are already a few of these programmed on the phone....so you need to disable them. Again, if you'd read the manual you'd know this.I have experienced the operating system lock up to the point where i had to remove the battery to reboot the phone. People need to understand that this phone is basically a miniture computer....with an operating system and memory and many other similarities. I hardly ever turn my phone off, so i don't complain when it locks up like that.Bad things about the phone:-The call log only shows the time of the call until the date changes over, then only shows the date of call. (example: I miss Grace's call at 10am on 2-11-05. The log will show the call at "10:00" until midnight and then it will show the call at "2-11-05." This is very annoying to me.)-The camera is pretty poor quality. Keep in mind though that this was one of the first generations of camera phones. If you want to take great pics, buy a regular digital camera. I just like the fact that if i need to, i can take a pic. This has come in handy on the job for insurance reasons.-The Sony-Ericsson site has some really cool things like a Theme editor where you can design how your phone display looks (similar to rightclicking on your desktop on Windows to change the colors and backgrounds). However, the site has had a problem ever since i first got my phone and hasn't fixed it. I can design as many as i want, but i can't download them. So i'm stuck with the themes other people designed.-The ringtones aren't polyphonic or whatever its called when they sound like actual songs. I can live without it, but it would be nice.-The camera requires absolute stillness!Besides that, its a great phone. I haven't gotten to really take advantage of the Bluetooth stuff yet though. The internet browser works fine if you pay the extra service charge for the access. The games are fine. There's a big selection to buy...you can even download ebooks to your phone (I actually got The Art Of War!!). You can make your own ringtones, there is a photo editor too so you can take pics and do funny things to them. When I see cool pics on the internet, i edit them to size then email them to my phone for desktop background (right now i got the matrix code on it).Most important thing i can say is read the manual. I've read a few pages of reviews here and most of the problems can be solved by configuring the settings. To save memory space delete all the lame preloaded pics that come with the phone, and when you take a pic with the camera that you don't need on the phone...email it to your hotmail or yahoo.

 review/summary: Sony Ericsson T610 is not reliable
 review/text: I owned it for 2 months now. The first time I got the phone, it jammed on me. The key pads on the phone was not to responding. When I get an incoming call, I tried to accept the call by pressing the &quot;yes&quot; button, it didn't take it. I exchanged a new phone with T-mobile, the second phone worked for 1 week. After that, it jammed on me again. Sony Ericsson T610 is definitely not a reliable phone. If one has a emergency, that would be a disaster because the phone key locks all the time. I can't wait till my contract ends so I can get out of this horrible phone and service. Also, signal is terrible. It doesn't work in buildings at all.

 review/summary: All the wrong reasons.
 review/text: I switched to this phone from Sprint in an attempt to save a little money. Aside from very poor coverage this phone is just terrible. The buttons are too small and I can barely dial correctly without holding the phone 2 inches from my face. The phone works poorly in crowded or noisy situations and and those I call have difficulty understanding me when I take a call while in a car. This coupled with unintuitive menus and seeming lack of shortcuts to any basic functions. I can't read the screen in direct sunlight. When I put the phone in my pocket it always dials someone unless I remember to "lock" the phone. The camera takes poor pictures, and stores very few. Bluetooth, 90% of people don't need it and if you turn it on it shortens your battery life. I just want to place calls quickly and easily and put the phone back in my pocket. This phone has a tiny joystick for navigating the impossible menus. That joystick is operated by your thumb and doubles as a button. More often than not I end up pressing the joystick too hard and selecting some unwanted menu while trying to navigate at a snails pace to the contacts menu. The entire phone's design is basically dismal. I'm almost at the end of my contract, I've been using this phone for nearly 10 months and I'm going STRAIGHT back to some sort of sprint flip phone. Then I'll be albe to 1. open phone 2. place call 3. close phone. Sounds almost too good to be true.

 review/text: According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COMBut if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake. I have ordered 2 "cell phone + service"s from Amazon. The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it. The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further". So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package, huh?

 review/summary: Decent phone, great price
 review/text: After reading all the bad reviews, I bought this phone because it was -$200. Bottom line, that really helps lower T-Mobile's bill over the next few months. First off, the phone isn't really all bad. Bluetooth, infared, nice little screen, joystick, and comes with a Windows software CD to sync your Outlook contacts. I've experienced no freeze or signal problems whatsoever in Dallas/Fort Worth Texas area.Of course, phone has many downsides: The power plug is the worst design ever. It's two plastic WIDE plugs with a metal contact between them. You must forcefully jam the plugs into your phone and hear a snap as it barely fits in. Only a matter of time before one of those plastic plugs breaks off and gets stuck in the phone, since pulling it out requires a lot of force. Also the headset is a non-standard propietary clip-on that snaps in hard like the charger. Why can't they just use a standard style plug? Camera quality is also really poor, I wouldn't recommend sending pics to anyone.Would I pay real money for this phone? No. But a price of -$200 sold me. Getting Outlook sync, decent screen, bluetooth, infared for that price made the phone a good purchase for a year's use. Then I'll switch to something superior in late 2005.

 review/summary: Not impressed
 review/text: I originally liked the looks of the phone just because it looked cool. It arrived this week and I was still impressed. It is small...light...attractive. Then I took it outside and as soon as sunlight hits it, you can't see the screen. The features are clunky...difficult to figure out basic things which i was used to with Sprint. The reception was also terrible. I was able to get 4 bars signal strength at my house, then I took it to work and got no signal. Granted I work in of all places...a building. I then took it to the mall here in Charlottesville to check the signal there and all I received was 1-2 bars...but the mall is an outdoor mall. I am just going to return it and hope I get better service from something other than T-Mobile.

 review/summary: there is a reason this phone is not OOS while others are
 review/text: I did not take the complaints about reception seriously since my house and office are both within a mile of major highways, and when my friends visited me with their t-mobile phones they got full strength signals in both places. Boy I was wrong.The signal meter was a joke - it jumps from 4 bars to 1 bar in a second while the phone sat still on a desk, then jumped back, etc.. -- and I thought it was just the meter; but the reception is really that unreliable -- the voice quality keeps varying and while standing at a spot that I got 3 bars when the call started, it would all of sudden drop to 0 bar and actually drop the call (on one occasion I was talking to T-mobile customer service and the call dropped the moment I got through the waiting -- pretty ironic).The phone has lots of features, but the navigation system design is very clumsy. Especially annoying is the lack of a shortcut back to the main/standby mode (the "end" button on most phones). Since the buttons are so small, it is very easy to accidentally get deep in some unwanted menus; to get out you'll have to repeatedly press "return". Such a pain.And yes, the screen is not bright enough to be viewed outdoors, and the body/lcd is always smeared with fingerprints or dusts due to the shiny, static-loving finish. (the lcd cover is also very easily scratched.)I'd give 1 star, but the price is not too bad (of course, if either of the rebate fails to go thru, this would be a realy bad deal).

 review/summary: Pretty good......not great!
 review/text: If you are looking for a really good phone, and don't care about the bells and the whistles, then I would say this is the phone for you. My cell phone is my life line to my business, so having a long battery life is one of if not the best feature of this phone.The design is fabulous. It is very durable, but a little on the small and light side (I guess which is a plus). I have dropped this so many times, and it still works like I just got it yesterday. The key pad is easy to navigate without looking, as is the menu.It is super easy retreiving missed calls, or calling back missed calls. Phone also offers name announcements, which you pre-record, as well as assigning special ring tones for different callers. Vibrate feature comes in handy.....it vibrates just enough that you can hear it without it disturbing or interfering what is going on around you at the office.The minor faults of this phone if you really care about these features are: camera is absolutely horrible; buttons on the sides are badly placed....always found myself pressing one of them when picking up the phone...maybe they were just too sensitive; signal is not as good and receptive as others; and NO SPEAKERPHONE - just bluetooth so you can go out and spend more money on an annoying earpiece.Overall, I must say it truly is a good phone. The only reason I am in the market for a new one is because my state has banned hand held cell phone use while driving, and I can't stand the ear pieces. If this phone had the speakerphone capability built in, I would stick with it and continue being happy.

 review/summary: PERFECT FEATURES FOR A CELL PHONE
 review/text: Thought:This phone comes with great features!! Unlike other phones, the T610 comes with features you wouldnt able to do with other phones. It also comes with infrared which you can hook up to other phones w/infrared or computer; with this feature you can send and recieve ringtones and pictures without being charged!Functions just like any other phone but more!The phone loads the menus very fast! faster then the Sony Ericsson T226 and other younger versions...The only problems is:Camera quality - yes, it does have poor camera quality, eventho the pictures you get from your computer or ordered are crystal clear, the camera is not clear. (strange how it supports over 63000 color but the camera is still weak)Voice Speaker - well this is not important to some people, i thought this cell phone has it all.Sound Recorder - it does what it does, but not high quality. When the recorded sound is played it is not loud enough. you got hold it up in your ear to hear some of it...Ringer - ok, im not sure about this but it seems like when i get a call, the ringtones doent play loud enough. My sisters phone (Samsung & NOKIA) ringers are very loud compare to the t610.Note- There are times when the phone malfunctions, im not sure if its t-mobiles technical difficulties or the phone itself. USUALLY its because of T-MOBILEs problems. if there problems with your T610 then just TURN it OFF and back ON. There so much features on this phone, you just wanna do everything at the sametime....Accessories:-the MP-10, this is the flasher for the t610. This flasher comes many features.-the Faceplates, change your look on the phone, it will look great.-the IrDA, the USB to infrared device for your computer, send and recieve pics,ringtones,games, and other information without being charged!!!! the 1# thing i love most!these are worth buying! BUY IT nOW!!!!OVERRALL: BEST Phone! some of my friends are buying this phone cause of its features and me showing it off hahhahhah!

 review/summary: Don't Bother With This Phone - Zero Stars!
 review/text: I was in the market for a new cell phone, preferably with a new provider. After reading positive and negative reviews of this phone, I was finally swayed into purchasing this phone due to the hefty rebates offered at Amazon.After about 6 hours out of the box (four of those hours charging), the phone's operating system locked up, and the screen is now blacked out (probably permanently). The phone only responds with a pleasant chime as it starts up, but sadly, nothing else.I sincerely thought that some of the negative reviews for this product were from purchasers with gripes against the manufacturer or service provider. At worst, maybe these bad reviews were isolated incidents, and I could beat the odds. However, in the end, I must sadly concede and admit that this is a terrible product and should be avoided at all costs. Hopefully, Amazon will allow me to exchange this for a different model and manufacturer.

 review/text: I love this phone! I ordered it from Amazon with the free Jabra Bluetooth headset. Even with activation, you can now end up getting paid (after rebate) to order this phone with T-Mobile service. I had Sprint before, but got dropped often (in Fairfield County, CT). No problems yet with T-mobile... and good coverage in the burbs even away from the highways. The fact that I can leave the phone in my bag and dial by voice via my cordless headset still amazes me. This is a no-brainer. The only problem is that you may have to wait a couple of weeks to get the phone as Amazon has been overwhelmed with orders for this phone.

BUT, it doesn't do awhole lot of stuff too. I think it maybe it may depend alot upon who your service provider, so be sure to check that T-Mobile hasn't reprogrammed your phone to do alot less than it's capable of. I can't even download games. As far as firmware goes, I have had a hell of a time finding that. I'd like to undo whatever T-mobile did do just to have the functionality it would have origionally came with had they not screwed around with the original software.

 review/summary: Whole world in the palm of your hand
 review/text: Kudos to Sony/Ericss!!! The T610 does so many things well. The interface is well thought out. The camera software is fast and you can email the pic with a few pushes of a button. I see many others fumbling through many menus to send pics with other camera phones. You can also text or 'SMS' people with intn'l numbers at no additional cost (tmobile). So you feel like a part of the world with this phone. And you are b/c it's triband, so it'll work in many countries. Wow, the T610 is packed with features in a tiny package. I feel as if there's 75% of my home computer in my hand, communication wise.My mom and two friends (various cities) bought this phone in the past few weeks, and they're thrilled. We have a little T610 club just based on how functional and easy this phone is to use. We even send each other contacts right from our phone books, and the T610 saves it in the recipient's phone book (emails and everything). There's a function that does that. Now how cool is that?! And Tmobile's GSM network is proving to be quite sturdy and fast for all of us LA, Chicago, NC. The 'porting' numbers phenom must be killing AT&T.;Cons: 1> Now, don't drop it, the shell with dent.2> It's so small, no ear-to-shoulder talking maneuvers or you'll drop it.3> A bit of a learning curve to get used to it (worth it).4> Get over the fact that it's better looking and smarter than you.5> Like a cat it 'sleeps' at the time, and the screen is dark in this mode (saving the batt). But it jumps to back to life quicky.No phone is perfect, it can't be, but darn this is pretty close. Highly recommend this phone. And you see the how hot this phone is on Amazon, they're back ordered. The secret is out!!PS. Transferring my number took a reasonable four days, despite the horror stories.

 review/summary: Lousy phone
 review/text: I have had enough problems to last a lifetime I guess. I moved from Sprint PCS to T mobile (thinking that their Service was good). I think I was wrong in doing that.The Sprint service was working fine. My Sony Ericsson phone does not have any reception at all in my office & has a Lousy reception at home as well!!!!!!!!!!T Mobile sent me a replacement Phone & as well as the SIm card in the hope that their service would improve. Unfortunately (to my horror & utter dis-belief) the service is no better. The service is fine after I checked the SIm on my friend's phone which is a NOKIA. T Mobile refuses to replace the phone with the same features...I will have to shell a good amount of money as well....All in all SOny Ericsson T610 is not a good one. At best I can say that it is a good one by itself..but not for T Mobile I guess.

 review/text: Hi,I was looking for this great phone adn when Amazon offered it for FREE i grabbed it there are various reasons why i purchased this phone let me highlight few features:1. Small and compact with great look from Sony2. Built in camera3. Bluetooth connectivity, this is awesome4. Quick access to settings and emails5. Various ringer tones6. Games, DJ Music, wallpapers7. Color screen, joy stick for navigatingNow let me share my experience after getting the best phone with T-mobile service which works the best in Chantilly, VA no other servic provider can give this.Got my connectivity wanted to checkout its features, clicked few pictures of my son and emailed it to my wife through t-zones (you got to have t-zones activated from T-mobile to send and recieve emails, messages it costs 2.99$ per month).If you want to upload the photo to your computer you can do using bluetooth or Infrared port, most of the computers have infrared port i used bluetooth of my Pocket PC and beamed to it within seconds the picture was there..Now i also ordered Jabra bluetooth headset another 20$ and it is worth it, handsfree you can recieve phone calls and make phone calls it has reception upto 10 feet (i had my friend walk little distance to check it out). The device was recongnized and this helps me a lot while driving, i do recommend this after all it is 20$ with this phone...Now onto Cons of this phone, somehow i didn't like the volume of this phone the maximum output is so low compared to other phones and if you work in downtown or places where there is lot of noise then better set it to vibrator mode or u will miss all ur calls...It is not a flip flop phone that means you have to lock and un-lock the keypad and that is something irritates me and was primary reason for me to switch new phone but after seeing all the features i gave away all my Cons and felt happier to have this hi-tech phone and my friends have started to think to get one....I will tell you &quot;You just can't miss this deal&quot; Free phone with bluetooth headset for 20$ it can't better, thanks to Amazon for a great deal and thanks to SonyEricsson for its phone and T-mobile for making yet another customer happy :)

 review/summary: not bad for a sony ericsson
 review/text: i was a little hesitant about getting this phone due to sony ericsson's bad rep but once i got it, i was amazed by it's performance. it fixed most of the problems of the previous ericsson models.the camera is ok and a little grainy but most camera phones are like that, it's nothing to get excited about but when i uploaded the pics onto my powerbook via bluetooth, there was a HUGE difference in picture quality...it looked alot better. the sound quality of the phone is a lot better compared to the nokia 3560 for AT&amp;T TDMA. the sound was very clear where as my nokia had a lot of background noise that was very light but still there. the menu takes some getting use to compared to nokia's super friendly one but it's nothing too difficult.it picks up better signal than my motorola v60 did. even when there's only 1 bar, my call is still clear and isn't choppy where as on my moto i hardly understood what the other person was saying.it's a great phone for people who have other devices with bluetooth. the size is perfect...it's not to big and it's not too small. the screen is a great size especially for viewing pictures because everything doesn't come out all microscopic.T-mobile's customer service is great compared to AT&amp;T's rude customer service. the only thing that bugs is having to clean the phone because it gets fingerprints on it soooo easily other than that i highly recommend this phone.

 review/summary: Nice to look at but not to use
 review/text: When I got this phone, it seemed to have everything I wanted: camera, color screen, pretty pictures, t-zones compatible. But the more I got to use it, the more I came to despise this phone. It does not get good reception, and I even had a T-mobile worker agree with me that the reception is not too good. I have dropped more calls than I can count on this phone. It will send people straight to voicemail and not give me a voicemail notification until hours later. (Not very convienient when people are trying to reach you.) I have been trying to exchange phones at T-mobile for a long time but most of the customer service representatives deny that the phone has reception problems. Overall, if you live in an area with absolutely no valleys, big buildings, or anything with a roof, than this phone is great, but if you ever want to be able to use a cell phone inside a building or in a valley or while you are driving, then DO NOT get this phone. It is not worth the cost. The camera does not even take very clear pictures. If you want a phone that works, sacrifice the fun gadgets and abilities and buy a nice, simple nokia or samsung.

 review/summary: Best Phone Yet
 review/text: After using about a dozen cell phones in the past 5 years I have found a phone I love to use. I get great reception (but it may be from switching from ATT Wireless to TMobile) and love the color display. My only two negatives about the phone is the keypad is a little small for my fat fingers (you should see me type on a full -size keyboard!). The other downside is the address book is a little hard to navigate (but that might be a learning curve on my part). I would feel very comfortable recommending this phone to a friend.

 review/summary: Bad reception
 review/text: I bought 2 phones. These phones have lots of good features. UNFORTUNATELY...Their reception is very bad. I also spoke to a friend who has inside info --&#62; most of the returns at that dealer is because of bad reception of these phones..Now, I am waiting to give up my phones after a year. I hope I knew this earlier.

Bottom line: Not nearly as great as it seems-

 review/summary: Flawed phone - not as good as it seems
 review/text: On the surface, this appears to be a good phone, and there's nothing to tip you off about two major flaws in any of the reviews or documentation available.1. You cannot store multiple entries for the same 10-digit phone number; for example, parents who live at the same house but carry different cell phones, or business contacts with the same main number and different extensions. Nor is there any provision for dialing an extension automatically after a main number. Say you deal with Tom in Marketing at 111-555-6666 ext 222 and Mary in Legal at 111-555-6666 ext 333. Most phones will allow you to insert a non-numerical character to indicate a pause before dialing the appropriate extension. Not so with the T610, which only allows numerical characters. Both Tom's and Mary's numbers would both be stored under Mary's entry in the phone book, and you will be, as I am, carrying an additional notepad with all their extensions on it.ADDENDUM: Thanks to Brightcell's contribution, I know how to insert a pause after a main number. :) However, the phone strips off non-numeric characters when importing from a PC address book, and there's nothing about "pressing and holding 7" in the T610 manual. Neither T-Mobile user support nor technical support was aware of this feature. To be completely fair, I tacked on a star to my overall rating.2. If you access your voicemail 20 times a day like I do, expect a lot of unnecessary keystrokes. Instead of a simple voicemail indicator flag like most phones, the T610 provides a text message (an e-mail) indicating you have a voicemail. You must read and delete this, then back out to the main menu to access your voicemail. The options menu for the e-mail message includes "Call Voicemail"...but this doesn't work owing to some incorrect programming (and I have verified this with T-Mobile tech support).ADDENDUM: Brightcell's contribution not withstanding, T-Mobile support confirms that there is no way for a user to turn this "feature" off. Their tech support rep offered to turn off voicemail notification altogether, which I declined. This, they said, was the ONLY way to make the notification e-mail stop. If pairing with T-Mobile service, be aware that they do not know how to make their service work properly with these phones.There are actually a number of other minor issues with this phone, including intermittent Bluetooth connectivity, a microphone that picks up every last bit of ambient sound and is almost impossible to use in a car, the fact that the battery wears out quickly even in "lock" mode because hitting any key activates the backlight...but all these things I could overlook, were it not for the two major issues above. On the plus side, it is small, cheap and has SOME kind of Bluetooth connectivity.

 review/summary: Review of Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile)
 review/text: Easy to use, nice screen, cheesy camera, bluetooth, IR, its got a good beat, I'll give it a 92, Dick.I have had this phone for about 1 week. I had read that the menus were hard to use but they are not. The sound quality is fabulous. The battery life is ok but not fabulous. The phone is very light. The camera is fun. I take pictures of my friends USING THEIR PHONE and then attach their picture to their entry in the address book (easily done). When they call their picture appears on the color screen.I always lock my SIM so that if someone steals my phone (or I lose it) then someone cannot put my SIM into their phone and call anywhere in the world. To lock my SIM took the help of T-Mobile support and a PUK code after we had no idea what the existing SIM code was.I wish it had more games built in. And although I understand the phone and can generally make it do anything it can do, I cannot change the ring notification for Appointments. Hmmm. I want to make it ring and ring and ring for a long time so I don't miss an appointment!!! Trying to figure this one out.--Star

 review/summary: Nice phone, good quality product.
 review/text: This mobile is really good. It is a lot faster in operation of the menus than my previous phones (Siemens, Nokia) The memory is a bit small, but you only run into problems if you take too many photos. I was disapointed that you have to pay for t-zones to send photos to email addresses, but instead you can always transfer the photo via IR to your computer and attach it manually. The little joystick nub thingy takes a little getting used to, but it really makes things easy to navigate. I don't know how to switch between networks manually on the phone but that isn't such a big deal as there is coverage most everywhere I go.

 review/summary: Star Trek Communicator - at last
 review/text: I came into the game late, waiting for a good phone (but not necessarily a PDA.) This phone has every feature I could anticipate for the next few years, including bluetooth and IR connectivity. It can also be unlocked and used in Canada or Europe with their local SIM cards. T-Mobile gets mixed reviews but I've had no problems with them...they have excellent coverage of the West and East Coasts of the US. They're also the only GSM network in the US (other than Cingular, which does suck) that I know of, so for me it's a no-brainer.

 review/summary: Amazing Phone with cool features and amazing amazon service
 review/text: I have had a lot of phones over 3 years (from nokia 3390, 3395, siemens, samsun ngh625 and lastly T616) and now i just recently bought two 610's. They are a piece of art. I have never loved any phone this much. And for the price (100 dollars back in pocket) there is no comparison.The ring tones are amazing, the contacts manager is just great. I love the bluetooth and sync it with my laptop all the time with my outlook. I love the feature of associating photos taken from the camera with the contacts so that when you get a call the photo pops up.Sound quality and reception has been comparable to most phones i had (i was on cingular and just moved to tmobile).The buttons might be a little small for someone with huge hands but they are fine.The gprs also works great to surf and email from the phone or surf the web from your bluetooth pc.The IRDA also works well but why use the slow connection when you have faster bluetooth.I have tried syncing between phones,pc,pda and everything works great.A must have if this is your first or the 50th

 review/summary: Looks cook, but somewhat couterintuitive usability...
 review/text: My review focuses on the ease of use of this phone's features. I'll begin with the negatives aspects first:CONS- Unable to display your own phone number or customized message on the main screen at all times.- Pressing either side scroll buttons displays the phone's status (date, profile, model, and own mobile #). These buttons would serve a better purpose if, for instance, they could change the ring volume. Instead you have to go through 3 or 4 menu steps just to change the volume.- Outdated firmware causes the phone to crash or lock up sometimes. Don't be surprised if you have to slide the back open and pop out the battery to do a hard reboot. Doesn't happen very often, but it does happen, and this is unacceptable when most phones NEVER crash.- Increasing ringtones - there is an option to disable this, but it doesn't function. It will always start off quiet for the first two seconds, then get louder.- Every time you get a voicemail, you also get a text message in your inbox. The text message basically says, &quot;you have 1 new voicemail, dial 123 to retrieve&quot;. You can select the &quot;123&quot; in the message and choose to listen to your voicemail. However, when you do this, the text message doesn't get automatically deleted. You have to manually go to your inbox and delete the messages you don't want to keep. Now imagine getting 10 or 20 voicemails... that's 10 or 20 text messages cluttering up your inbox.- Call log entries are displayed on 1 line. First the name is shown, then after three seconds, the phone number replaces the name, then after another two seconds the time (if today) or date (if past date) replaces the time/date. So it basically takes about 5 seconds to see all the info for one missed/incoming/outgoing call. There's no way to show this info faster by scrolling through it manually, and no way to see all the info at once by selecting the call entry.- If you want to record a quick voice memo for yourself, and you select the Voice Notes to record it, it gets stored in a very unconventional manner. To play back the memo, you have to now go to the Messaging-&gt;Picture-&gt;Unsent menu path. A better way to store a voice memo is to go to Pictures &amp; Sounds-&gt;Record Sound. Then the memo will be placed under My Sounds. For some reason, the sound quality is also better using the latter method.- You are allowed to customize only one direction of the joystick, which is left. Pressing up on the joystick takes you to the last entry of your phonebook. Pressing down takes you to the first entry of your phonebook. Pressing right takes you to the icon selection screen where you see 4 rows of 3 icons representing (from upper left to lower right): Voice Notes, t-zones, My Shortcuts, Camera, Phonebook, Entertainment, Pictures &amp; Sounds, Messaging, Calls, Connectivity, Organizer, Settings.PROS- Bluetooth is a cinch to set up. Got connected to my PowerBook and Jabra headset in less than 10 minutes. Easy to transfer files to/from the phone.- RF reception is not as bad as many people make it out to be. If another tmobile user was standing next to me using a different phone, and they were getting clear connections, so was I. If they were getting bad connections, so was I. We tested this in various locations, even in fringe areas where we got 1 or zero bars on the signal meter. Signal strength was more attributeable to the network and not so much the phone.- Easy to snap a picture. Press a button on the left side to go into camera mode, then press the same button or the joystick or the Capture menu selection to take the picture. After, you're given the option to discard it or send it to someone. Or if you just want to save it for viewing later, press the exit button and it will ask if you want to save it.- Easy to send your contact info to someone.In conclusion, if you already have a mobile phone and service, I would wait a few weeks and get the T630 when it comes out. And if you have to get a new phone today, I would seriously shop around first before buying the T610. There is much room for improvement in the T610's usability to let you do things faster, and hopefully they'll fix some of the more serious problems like firmware so it doesn't crash. There is a reason why amazon is paying you to take this phone off their hands. Because they can't give enough of them away.

 review/text: I have had this phone with T-Mobile plan for 6 months now. As Amazon was offering a great deal on it, I and 2 of my friends bought it together.First friend's experience:He is happy with phone. Works great. Reception is great. He gets great singals in his house and other confined palces.My experience:Very bad signal strength. In the same room where my above mentioned friend has a great singal strength, my phone is totally out of signals. And now, the display has developed a patch. Perhaps LCD has burnt out. I called Sony for repaire. They want me to mail it to some place and I will have to be without phone for 8-10 days. They are not willing to provide a replacement.Second friend's experienceHis phone went dead just in two days. He got a replacement. That wend deat also. He got a third phone and he has OK signal strength (not really great, not bad either).One common problem that we all have faced is that during some operations it freezes completely and we have to reboot the phone (I guess some bug in phone OS)

 review/summary: YOU ARE EXPECTING TOO MUCH.
 review/text: Seriously. Stop expecting so much from a phone that you were PAID to take. In fact, if you do order this phone, expect it to be a piece of junk. Then, when you get it, and you may or may not find that it isn't, you won't be disappointed either way.I am quite disgusted by anyone who rated this phone less than 4 stars. Take the value of this deal into consideration, not just how well the phone works. If someone paid me $150 to take something, I wouldn't care HOW bad it was.And if it turns out that you truly hate this phone and cannot live with it- then you don't have to. All you have to do is get a phone that you LIKE off ebay or amazon marketplace. (Make sure it is a gsm phone that can be used with T-Mobile- gsm 1900 mhz.) A Nokia 3595 or 6010 will be just fine for someone who just wants to call and send text messages, and they cost less than $50. Feature-filled phones will obviously cost more. Once you get the phone, take your sim out of your t610 and pop it in the other one. Now you can sell your t610 on ebay. In fact, you might end up making even more money.(Example: You got paid $150 for taking the t610. You buy a 3595 off ebay for $30. You sell your t610 for $100. Overall, you were given a $30 phone and $220 in cash.)And even if you don't save more money, you will be getting that other phone for a very, very low price.(Example. You got $150 for taking the t610. You buy a new, $300, loaded phone off eBay. Then, you sell your t610 and get $100. Overall, you got a $300 phone for $50.Even if you end up hating this phone, this is still an awesome deal.

 review/summary: Excellent!
 review/text: Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10.

However, on usage, several problems surface.While there are many good things, including one of the most durable batteries system I have seen, I have a few complaints.The power cord and handsfree phone cord are not standard jacks.. but, "specially" designed for this phone. The jacks get loose and to charge your phone, besides plugging in, U have to attain the carefull balance of a tight rope walker.The blue tooth connection is a little slow. This was my first experience with blue tooth.. but, I am a bit disappointed with that.Overall, the phone is OK

 review/summary: It's almost perfect.
 review/text: I've been using my T610 from T-Mobile for 3 months. I needed a phone, that would have a camera, color display and support bluetooth technology and internet access. I found one.T610 has a camera and bluetooth - I like both these features very much. For example, bluetooth is very convenient to have an access to the phones pictures, melodies and themes from anything supports bluetooth technology. I use my desktop, my notebook and my iPAQ as well. Besides I can use a wireless headset, and I use it even when I don't drive. And of course I use my T610 when I surf the Internet of check my e-mail from the PDA (iPAQ h4155). The camera is not so perfect, but you can take small pictures in a moment you want. So T610 is the camera, that is always with me.And if we talk about phones with a color display, internet capabilities, a camera and bluetooth, there's the only one competitor for T610 in the USA - Nokia 3650. Well, I like Nokia phones. I've been having three Nokias before: 5110, 8210 and 8310. They worked perfectly. But I've never liked Nokia 3650. First of all, it's too big for me. I like small phones - and T610 has almost the same size as my previous Nokia 8310. Nokia 3650 is too big, too ugly and has an unusual and incovenient keyboard. That's because I've bought T610.Now I can call, take pictures, send and recieve text and picture messages and e-mail, surf the Internet, play games (included or previously downloaded from the Internet), make notes (and voice notes as well) and more. Once I recorded my playing guitar by my phone and send it by e-mail to my friend. She was very excited, listening it on her computer. Thanks to my T610.

 review/text: This phone offers everything you need. It's like a secretary. The features include a calendar, internet, camera (etc.). The camera is the best part because once someone in your phonebook has a picture, that picture shows up when they call or text you. The camera also comes with effects (B&W, Sepia or Negative). For the games you get minigolf (pretty good), deep abyss (like mario in a volcano), and five stones (basically tic-tac-toe). Any other questions just e-mail me.

 review/summary: Great, cute little phone
 review/text: It's a great little phone. Awesome downloadable ring tones, and the camera is useful enough for you to take quick pictures on the go. T mobile seems to have really good customer service reps. Amazon service reps kind of sucked though, so don't anticipate much help from amazon.

 review/summary: Everything except what you want.
 review/text: I continue to be impressed with the multitude of features this phone has. Everything from its chip memory to recording conversations to text, email, picture messages and so on and so forth. It does maybe one hundred things and not one of them it does well. The features I have used include pictures, contact management, emailing, and text. I have not had the opportunity to use the Bluetooth features. The camera takes grainy pics that look horrible even when there is enough ambient light. Perhaps on the surface of the sun there is enough light to take an adequate picture. Absolutely forget about taking pics indoors; even with the &quot;night mode&quot; turned on.My primary complaint however is that it uses contactors on the bottom to attach the headset in lieu of the standard headphone plug. I prefer talking on a headset because the phone itself is too small to talk into and gets uncomfortable in a hurry holding it. I also appreciate having my hands free while on the phone especially while driving. These contactors often get dirty which mean they don't make contact and fail. This leaves you wiggling the wires yelling "Hello? Hello?" and blowing on the bottom of the phone like you would for your old 8-bit Nintendo system until you are fed up enough to simply pull it. I could easily solve this problem I suppose by buying a Bluetooth earpiece. Yes, all it would take is a $90 earpiece to fix a phone that cost me $99.The same applies to a charger where the two copper strips are to make contact, it rarely does. You may think your phone is charging all night but has really sat idle. The view screen although nice and pretty to look at is useless in brightly lit areas. The screen simply isn't bright enough to read on a sunny day. The network isn't developed well enough in S Florida to handle the new, what's it called GMS network.There certainly is a lot of sizzle to this steak. Primarily it is a cell phone. As a cell phone, its terrible. I expect this phone to be a terrible day planner. This phone will do anything you could ever want a cell phone to do as long as one of those things isn't talking to other people.

 review/summary: Phone will freeze
 review/text: Got this phone for about 6 months, and overall it is ok, not as user friendly as Nokia, but get used to it. One bad thing is this phone will freeze itself. Try to exchange with another phone, but T-Mobile exchange program only give a refurbished one, not a new one, and after exchange, only have limited warranty.

 review/summary: Great phone, even better offer on amazon!
 review/text: The price was right(-100.00!!), the phone is easy to use, and the number transfer from at&amp;t was painless, although not very quick(it took a week). Reception and sound quality have been good.The only issues I have with the phone so far are:1. The placement of the &quot;back&quot; button. It is to the left of the joystick, where as every other phone I have owned it has been to the right.2. The T-Mobile button on the right hand side needs to be able to be changed to do something else.3. The transfer of contacts from Outlook was easy, although it wasn't quick via IR.

 review/summary: Good phone...
 review/text: I had a T68i before this and like the camera, flash accessory and text messaging. I had a code for a while where you can get free internet access using the t610 as a modem wirelessly with the powerbook's bluetooth connection... pretty cool. I have the bluetooth connected to the PowerBook with Salling Clicker software, I can control iTunes wirelessly (which is playing wirelessly over Airport Express), it is easy to send any midi file to the phone to use as a ringtone. The text messaging is fast and easy, although the whole interface for SE phones isn't lightning fast, but it works well. Mini golf is great, the other games kind of suck. The flash accessory doesn't actually "flash," but does add light, so you can take pictures in bars again (that's why we all got camera phones, right?). Get the Krussel case, it opens in the back to use the camera, my t610 would have been toast over a year ago if I didn't get one.... drop it all the time. Good case. Good iSync compatibility with Apple's iCal program, you can sync all contacts and calendars, although taking the phone to a different time zone can be hazardous for all of your already scheduled calendar events, they will be offset and not corrected sometimes upon returning to your home's timezone. Not sure how to fix that yet, but it's still pretty cool. I paid *full* price for this phone when it came out and it's been worth it and a way better choice than the t300 that was being offered at the time. The picture resolution is very low, though. They look OK on email. Make sure and get the next model up on this phone, because now the screen is easier to read in daylight (can be very hard with the t610). If I get another phone, it'll have to be of similar caliber and functionality with this one, and it won't be until this one bites the dust (knock on wood).

 review/summary: Not too bad, this little thing!
 review/text: My girlfriend gave this cell phone to me as a birthday present and I was thrilled about it. I read some of the other reviews where people said they had poor reception with this phone but I think it's cause of the service (T-Mobile) not because of this phone. I have AT&T wireless and so far I have never had a reception problem unlike my old Nokia phone (also with AT&T wireless). The really cool thing about this phone is that it is Bluetooth enabled. I can transfer ring tones and pictures to and from my laptop wirelessly and use a wireless Bluetooth earpiece to make calls when I am driving. Battery life could have been a little better but it's not that bad considering it has a big, bring color display. The camera also could have been a little better. Over all, this is not a bad phone.

 review/summary: good phone...
 review/text: I got the t610 through T-mobile and bought on amazon... therefore I will recieve cash back for buying it. a lot, apparently. so, can't beat that...Others have truly criticized some things about this phone. some of those criticisms are valid and others are just kind of silly. Here is my own list.good things:-- bluetooth is indeed flawless with a Mac (OSX) and I assume with windows too. I had to buy a $40 usb-bluetooth adapter for my older powerbook. I make full use of the Syncing of my address book and iCalendar (I use both applications intensively and recommend them.) you might need to fiddle with what time zone you tell your phone you are in, or whether you tell the phone it's daylight savings time -- sometimes appointments get translated to the other device one hour off.-- physical design is sharp and the large screen is great and impressive. the user interface is just very crisp and impressive, like you're looking at a recent computer OS. I wish some of the downloadable Themes i find on the net were as good as two of the ones built in ("T-mobile" and "magma glow.")-- having bluetooth and infra red is cool -- I was able to beam pictures to the photo printing kiosk at my locan drug store using IR.-- camera is cool... yes, it's only limited size and not incredible resolution, it's for FUN, not art.-- the user interface makes up for some of its frustrating slow aspects by having a "shortcuts" menu on the home menu that you can customize, bringing almost any feature to 3 clicks from the home.-- some cool games to download. Townsmen ($5) is fun, like a mini simCity... but the backgammon game I bought is slow and absurdly graphical... god, anything for a bare bones backgammon game like on the nokia!bad things-- reception for me (T-mobile in washington DC) is sometimes disappointing. granted, I live in a cellar. but I think there's a chance that other phones on T-mobile, using different frequencies than this one, will be better.-- the user interface is not as crisp and hyper-smart as on my nokia phones. sending a text message can be a ridiculous experience until you learn to use various short cuts. Even if you are sending an sms to someone already in your phone book, it COULD be click-down-click-click-click-type message-click-click-click-scroll to address entry-click-click-click. Absurd -- some of those clicks are in effect telling it, for instance, that you want to scroll through your address book entries in the phone, not the ones stored on your SIM chip. they could make that a default. Fortunately, unless you are un-techie, you learn shortcuts. (1) hitting left on the joystick from the start takes you to a blank sms screen. or (2) you can program stuff into your "shortcuts" menu. (3) they thankfully, like in nokias, attach numerical values to all menus, so you can just tap your way through common choices.-- yes, it is a drag that you can not turn off the ascending ring feature... fortunately for me, I prefer that setting.-- god, I wish it would simply automatically erase old entries in your recieved and sent SMS messages folders. it doesn't, so every once in a while you must manually clean them out. Nokias are better that way.-- it is true that reading the screen in the bright outdoors is hard. bummer, but fortunately not THAT common a problem. the T630 (the next version) is supposed to fix that.

 review/text: I will have to admit, this is my first headset to own and use. I researched a lot to find a headset that would be comfortable on my ear and have quality audio on both sides of the conversation. The Voyager 510 has all of this. It is however larger than most, if not all of the bluetooth headsets out on the current market. So if you don't mind a little larger headset, this is a great buy. It has great battery life and has a large radius to reach your bluetooth device. It currently works seamlessly with both my computer and Razer cell phone. To keep it protected, I got an old Altoids metal box, padded the inside, and I keep my headset in there when I am mobile.

 review/summary: Barely worth the goldbox price
 review/text: I bought this on a gold box special for $17.99. And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason.

 review/text: I purchased Plantronics 665 headset to replace BlackBerry 655+ by Plantronics that went through washing machine (but surprisingly still worked fine after drying). My wife also has one of these and she loves it.I like 665 as much as I like 655+. The fit is comfortable and secure with the ear loop. The sound quality is good on both ends. The battery life is sufficient for me I charge it once every two-three days.The only complaing is that the buttons are a bit hard to press. When I push the main button the ear tip gets pushed into my ear which is not very pleasant.Overall, this is a great headset at a good price.

 review/summary: It Does Everything But Cook Dinner
 review/text: Alright, I never used my cell phone much until this was given to me by my brother. It has a camera. It has an MP3 player. I've figured out so many ways to amuse myself with this phone. I admit I've gotten bored as you usually do with 'toys', but this phone is quality as well. The speakerphone is excellent. The charge seems to last forever. The games are similar to a PS2 quality, if not basically the same (visually that is). It has Memory Stick Duo which can hold MP3's, pictures and whatever else. This phone also has BLUETOOTH technology and infrared, which stunned me one day at Staples when I sent a picture on my phone to a PDA on display in the store. And it was free. It is easy to use and there are so many options with this phone. It has EDGE and GSM data communication. It does everything. The screen is gigantic and has the best of any phone I have seen. This phone might be a little outdated (who cares) but I like it. The only issue is the fact that it's really large....but that doesn't bother me. It has everything. Record movie clips, pictures...sound recording, media maker, all kinds of things you can do to amuse yourself.If you're looking to purchase a cell phone and you're pricing digital cameras as well, I'd go for this and save money. The 1.3 MP camera isn't the best you can get---(I'd go for Sony's 7.3 Cybershot or my personal favorite the Sony Cybershot W5)...but this phone will do everything you could want...and more than you need probably...probably way more than you need.

 review/summary: Great phone
 review/text: I am happy with the phone function as a phone--great reception, clear graphic display, and loud speaker phone. But what I enjoy most about this phone is its ability to connect with my computers: both Mac and PC. Address book import via Bluetooth is done in less than a minute. The memory stick (with multi slot USB reader/writer included in the box) enables the user to transfer files between the computer and the phone. So basically, I can transfer any midi/mp3 files from my computer to my phone and either play them or make them my own ringtones. With a Mac, it's even easier with the plug-and-play method. Picture files are also transferrable- importing and exporting pics are just as easy. I think it's a great buy for those who would enjoy the phone as much as its media functions. But if you want to buy a phone just for communication purpose , i.e., just for talking, you might be paying too much for the excessive functions you may never use.

 review/summary: The Sony Ericsson is an excellent cell phone
 review/text: My #1 complaint with the Sony Ericsson S710a would be some of the reviewers. One reviewer stated something like, " it was annoying having to open the S710a to take a picture", guess they didn't read the manual. Someone stated, "small keys", I have big hands and had no problem with the recessed keys. This was a good one, "the hands free ear piece was to loud" well there's volume control buttons. By the way they never mentioned the little chrome button on the mouthpiece of the hands free that you press to answer or press to hang-up.I have also heard complaints about the swivel opening of the S710a. I do feel this swivel style is much stronger than a hinged flip style since there is a much larger bearing surface allowing less of a chance of cracked and broken hinges as I've seen on other hinged portable equipment.Although I haven't checked battery talk time I know I get at least 4 hours and it takes about 1 hours to recharge.I don't consider the S710a big and bulky for what it has and that is an excellent camera. Without reading the camera instructions I found it easy to use to take pics of my daughter in her Halloween costume.I was pleasantly surprised to find I could read the display and number buttons without glasses. The display is bright and sharp, as a matter of fact at times I use the brightness of the display as a flashlight at night walking on my unlit driveway (there is also a camera light).Sound quality is crisp and clear even when Cingular reception isn't the best. If you don't want to hold the phone next to your ear the speakerphone has excellent clarity.All I wanted was a good phone and I got a lot more. I bought a second for my daughter's mother so she can capture all those things I taught my daughter to annoy Mommy, Auntie P and Grandma..

 review/text: So the good:Cool looking, great pics, large screen, MP3 capability (Yet to use).And the bad:After 5 months, the battery charger started to show signs of not wanting to work without having pressure applied to it when plugged in. Then the indicator that says the battery is charging stopped showing that it was charging, but was still charging. After that, it just stopped charging completely and the red illuminator light that showed something was plugged in stopped and the phone died.Sent to Cingular for warranty, however I realized that I left the Sony Memory Stick in which they claim they cannot send me back anymore so there is $30 dollars lost!Overall, minus the phone dying and the bulkiness of it, it was a good phone. Hope you have better luck then I did.

 review/summary: Good phone, good pocket PC
 review/text: I bought this phone knowing that I would need a data plan in order to get the most use out of this phone, so the fact that Amazon requires you to purchase a data plan was no big deal to me. The phone functions as advertised--it has the same pros and cons as other pocket PCs. The battery life is decent, and the sound quality is good (although the speaker quality is not the best). Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The fact that the phone was only $75 compared to $250 at T-Mobile was a no brainer.The one concern that I had was that I wanted to keep my phone number from Verizon Wireless, and there was no information on whether I would be able to do this if I purchased the phone through Amazon. Fortunately, I had no problems--once the phone arrived, I just called up T-Mobile and gave them my old account information and everything was switched over within a few hours. On a side note, I've found T-Mobile customer service very helpful and responsive.

 review/text: This product says "U.S. version," but there is nothing American about it. Mine came only with Spanish instructions and a foreign electrical cord and adapter that is not UL listed. I will not use it because I consider it unsafe. The description should make it clear that this product was not manufactured for use in the US. I am returning this unit. I bought the w200a directly from Sony Ericksson and it is exactly what I expected.

 review/summary: Nice phone for the money
 review/text: I've had this phone for a few weeks now and love it. It looks sharp (like a black RAZR), but not many people have this. I got it because it was cheap and different. It has Cingular Video and high speed data (3G, but only in certain large areas). Good battery life and clarity. Loud speaker phone, blue tooth. Cool camera too, seems like a nice, durable phone.Cons:It doesn't allow you to change to soft keys. The phone ring type ascends only, you cannot change this. Seems like the voice of the person you are talking to also ascends slightly. The alarm doesn't have volume controls, but I don't use that anyway. There are a few minor user interface flaws, but overall a great phone. I would recommend it.

 review/summary: HATE IT
 review/text: I absolutely hate this phone. Everyday it makes me want to throw it out my window. I switched to Cingular from Sprint in August strictly because most of the people I talk to have Cingular and I kept going over my minutes. So I didn't really like any of the phones they had in-store (I went to 3) and I didn't want the Razor and the guy told me that this was the best phone they had and it would definitely get better reception than the Razor. BULL. I am missing having Sprint with my beautiful tiny silver Samsung, I think it was the A670 (that Cingular does not have).1. The reception sucks, and it's not Cingular. My boyfriend and his sister both have Cingular, they live out in the sticks and they both get service just fine and I don't. He has a Nokia, she has the Razor.2. Half the time it says I have full service but it won't ring. So I miss most of my calls and txts cuz the stupid thing doesn't ring.3. You can't assign Ringtones to particular people! What the heck, this phone has an MP3 player but you can't assign ringtones, which I didn't realize 'till I already purchased 3. I called LG and they said you could only assign them to groups, which I did exactly how they told me to and I could never get it to work.4. My old phone had lights on the outside that would blink if you missed a call or a msg, and you could have the option of having it actually beep if you missed a call or a msg, this phone doesn't do that so I am constantly having to check it.5. It is really quiet, both the ring and the voice, and the speakerphone isn't that loud. By boyfriends 4 year old Motorola he had before his new Nokia had a way better speaker.6. It has the absolute worst battery life in the world. Sometimes I won't use it all day, I won't even open it, and the batter will be dead. What the heck is up with that?The only good thing I can say about it is that I like the big screen and the picture quality is really good. It would have been nice to not have to buy the cord to download the pictures separately though, the phone was nearly $200, they could have at least thrown the cord in, or at least the car charger, I had to buy that too, which was $30 and quit working about 3 months after having it.I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone, I don't know if it's LG or just the model but it is the cause of major frustration for me every single day! If I could give it zero stars I would have.

 review/text: I've had this for a few weeks and at least the ones I got seem to be durable enough, I don't have any problems with the adapter fitting my phone or headphones. There is no loss in sound quality that I can detect using 256k mp3s over $200 Klipsch headphones. For the price, they are pretty much perfect. (Yes there is no mic, but it doesn't say it comes with one, does it?) I'll probably get another one for the aux adapter in my car, so I can leave one with my headphones and one in the car.

Shipping was fast and the customer service was terrific. I ordered two of these, because I thought at this ridiculously low price there was a good chance they didn't work well (if at all)--I was wrong, they work GREAT! And as an added bonus, the company sent me 4 of them and only charged me for 2! Great company, great product...I definitely recommend them.

 review/text: This device is dirt cheap, which makes it worth buying because you can get several of them. You'll need them too, because they don't last very long. I've gone through about 4 of them over the last 2 years so you should expect about 6 months out of it. The sound quality is good and there doesn't seem to be any interference while it's still in good condition, but when it starts to short you might hear static or lose a channel of audio. The plastic clips sometimes break and the wire shorts out after a while. Still, for the price, they're a good buy.

 review/summary: Good phone but bad battery
 review/text: When you need a basic, cheap cell phone this is it. It was free with 2 year contract. It has most of the functionality that you expect from a basic phone: speakerphone, silent ringer. Internal display can be seen in sunlight, speakerphone is excellent, ringer is loud. The phone is sturdy. It fell many times and still works. The only problem which I think is serious is that the battery is horrible. I bought 2 phones from verizon. First phone needed to be recharged every 18 hours the other could live for 2 days if you do not use the phonr. I brought the first phone to verizon but they said that 18 hour stand by time was good for the phone. After some alot of whining on my part they switched my battery and they turned out to be right. I experienced no change in battery life. Now one year into my contract I had to get used phones from my friends because both of my phones could not be taken of the recharger. Also it has poor signal reception (maybe because it does not have retractable antennae) It does not have battery eating extras like camera, bluetooth, mp3 player.

 review/summary: Great Phone Great Network
 review/text: I think this phone is great for what it does... It is a striped down phone that connects to a great network flawlessly.In response to the previous review maybe you should take a look at the Motorola v260 the Kyocera kx1 or the LG vx4650. But it is interesting that your objection to the phone is the ring tones! You say you want a striped down phone but are willing to switch networks to get different ring tones? If you don't want a kid-targeted phone then why would you want a kid-targeted network?

 review/text: This has been a great case! I tend to abuse my keyboard, and after a year, the case still looks new. I thought that the letters would have rubbed off by now, but they are still pretty bright. The rubber gives the phone a more comfortable feel when typing. It definitely gives you more grip. I recommend it highly as my phone does not have any scratches.

 review/summary: No more hanging wires
 review/text: The Jabra EarBoom Winder finally makes it possible to use a earphone without having wires hanging all over. I really like having my cell phone hooked up to an earphone set, but didn't like the wires hanging down all the time or worse yet, tangled up in my pocket. The Jabra winder keeps everything neat and handy. The only problem is the ear gels fall off when you're not looking...and later so will the foam cover for the microphone. A little double-sided tape seems to have fixed the problem for me. I think you'll like this set after you make sure the ear gel and microphone foam are secured.

 review/text: This is the third brand of headset I have tried and I keep going back to my old standby, a Motorola H555. The Cardo is OK but the ear loop broke after 2 weeks and I only use it about an hour a day. The signal doesn't seem as strong as the Motorola but the sound quality is pretty good. I am still looking for the perfect headset. My next pick will be a Plantronics 520.

The only downside to this phone is the short battery life. Otherwise I love this phone and would recommend it to everyone and anyone. Cingular has terrific service towers and I never drop a call.

The Intel 312MHZi is very fast and the keyboard is perfect. The only downside to this and most PDA devices is they make better PDA's than Cell Phone. I use my 8700C just for business emails and I love it.

On both of the holsters I purchased, this little tab broke off. Very poor design and substandard manufacturing. Don't waste your time or your money on this item.

 review/text: The new battery I received appears to be a factory original which is good. The problem is it will not hold a charge any longer than the old battery I was replacing. I can't say for sure that it is the battery or if the problem is with my phone but because of the cost of shipping to return it and get a replacement I am in a no-win situation. The battery arrived on time and packaged well. I just don't think I can come out ok on this and will probably just buy a new phone.

 review/text: If you're the type of person that doesn't spend HOURS on the phone, and want a good basic phone, this phone is for you. I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks, and it works great. I would say that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. It's a nice BASIC phone. The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones.

 review/summary: Thank goodness this phone is obsolete...
 review/text: I hate my phone. Let's be honest, I had insurance on my previous phone, and I lost it, but they (Cingular) would not replace my phone with a like kind because it was an early pre-blackberry qwerty N-GAGE (2200 I think), so they gave me this lump of coal as replacement. Another shot against it was it was a refurbished model, whch makes sense since it was an insurance replacement and you know how big companies really like to pinch your penny. After 6 months my mic is going bad, and more than half the time the person I'm talking to cannot hear me, or can barely hear me. The phone FEELS cheap, weak, and flimsy. Now, I know I could invest in a bluetooth headset, but I don't want to sink money into a phone I don't like anyway. Instead I use the accessory wired headset leftover from my 2200. Sorry guys, this phone is just plain awful.

 review/summary: Not good for the soft-spoken, or the extended talker
 review/text: I've got a very soft voice, so generally have to pick earpieces that pick up a lot. I was replacing aPlantronics mx150 Verizon wired Hands-Free w/ call end, answer & Voice Dialingthat I'd had for about 3 years. I chose this thinking it was going to be as good. Unfortunately, no one could hear me on it.As far as in the ear comfort goes, I thought it was going to be better than the under the lobe support. I normally talk for hours in the evening and I was getting a little bothered by the original one. Unfortunately, this was less comfortable, and I felt like I was getting an earache after a few days of using it. I tried to use the over the ear support but the little connector snapped the first time I tried to connect it. (And yes, I was trying to be careful.) Switching ears was a pain as well since you had to line up the inner part with the boom.Personally, I trashed this and bought another of the Plantronics when I upgraded my phone last month.

 review/summary: Quite happy with so far...
 review/text: I purchased this item as a replacement for a lost Motorola bluetooth headset for my Treo 650. As I lost my prior headset (and I am not a careless or disorganized person) I decided that a larger model might be a better idea. I have been quite happy with the sound quality and ability to hear, even when in an area with a lot of ambient noise. The multiple gel earpiece covers are a definite plus, as is the USB cable. Pairing the headset with the Treo worked fine. The only reason I am giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is that the style is a bit more functional than stylish.

 review/summary: Simply a perfect phone
 review/text: I've been using GSM phones for about 15 years in Europe.I moved to the US last year and not knowing anything about US service providers, I decided to go for AT&T...; what a disastre (great national coverage - worst customer service I've ever dealt with - terrible international coverage). So I decided to change and tried T-Mobile (just felt right - perfect so far)and got the V600 mainly for its multi-band capabilities through Amazon. It's by far the best phone I've ever had. Easy to use, perfect camera for phone to phone or e-mail use. Great battery life. Perfect national coverage aswell as in Asia and all over Europe (speak for T-Mobile and the phone). I bought a protective cover as the phone surface scratches easily.The perfect phone for people who travel all over the place.

 review/summary: great charger so far...
 review/text: I have bought a few cheap chargers for my Sony/Ericsson w300i phone, and they have all been junk. So I decided to buy a Sony/Ericsson charger for a change. Seems to be a good choice; I've had no problems with the charger, and it even comes equipped with a small penlight-type light (built in to the "cord end" of the charger, where it attaches to your phone). I recommend this charger to anyone looking to replace a cheap, non-OEM car charger.

 review/summary: Poor design for Palm IIIc
 review/text: To use this product, you have to remove the plastic hard cover from your Palm IIIc organizer. The leather case fastens with a snap so you could attach it to a belt,purse,or brief case, etc. But, it flops around and is not easily accessed for quick use. I wanted a product similar. And, I sure wish I could design my own. I want a clip on leather case - (secure fit like ones used for pagers). I want to be able to open the leather case easily, then, raise the plastic cover and use the orangizer. It would also be nice to have a place to store an extra stylus and credit cards or name cards. Thank you. I will keep searching.

 review/summary: Poor quality JUNK!
 review/text: I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life. After about 1-2 months of use, the thing shorted out and wouldn't work any more. I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured I'd give it another chance... the thing didn't even work out of the box this time.I only wish I could give it Zero stars... spend the money on a Motorola brand charger instead.

 review/text: Not a bad product but it doesn't work for my BB 8700c even though the maker's web site says it does. The problem I have is that my BB is on BES and using this keyboard requires security changes that are administered by the BES administrator. If you are not very technical or if you use BES, I suggest you look for another product.On the bright side, I did get this to work with my PS3. Not all of the keys work on it, though.

There is so much research that verifies the danger of EMF radiation from cell phones and other electrical devices I use them as little as possible What excites me about this device is that it doesn't claim to block, absorb or deflect the harmful radiation emitted from electrical products, but renders the radiation harmless to the human body.

 review/summary: did not notice any difference with cell phone
 review/text: Okay, I have to say that I really wanted to believe this would work. I have only recently gotten a cell phone again after discontinuing the very low use of the one I had before. I can not use a cell phone for more than an hour or so a week, as I am highly sensitive to the effects. When I talk on a cell phone held to my head or with an earpiece for more than two or three minutes, my ear literally goes numb inside. I switch sides, to talk a few more minutes, until the other ear is numb and then I beg the person to let me hang up immediately. Using the speakerphone, I am spared from my ear going numb inside right away, and instead I just get extrememely yucky feeling, headachy and like my nervous system is irritated and I want to drop the phone in a hole in the ground and get as far away as possible. Soooo...all this to say, I would KNOW if this thing worked.I thought at first, perhaps it did, when just holding my phone while it was on. But, as soon as I took a phone call on it, I was in the same position after talking several minutes. By the time we got to 1/2 an hour using the speakerphone and holding it in my hand (I was pushing it since I had this supposed device on the phone) I was ready to drop the phone in a trash can again. I have tried several different types of cell phones, so it's not the particular phone.This device simply does not work in my opinion. Save your money...and even more important, please condsider not taking on a false sense of security from having it! I have tried other devices in the past years on electronics that seemed to help a little at least. They were not as thin as stickers, as these literally are, just stickers! I am not trying to bash this company, I just want to put out a "buyer beware" to counter all these reviews that I read before purchasing it, giving them 5 stars. Maybe I am just crazy, but I truly could not tell any difference at all. And, it was not from being over skeptical or a lack of wanting it to work!I have a call into their customer service to attempt to get my money back. They said a manager would call me back tomorrow. Live and learn. I don't regret trying it, as if anything actually worked, it would be heaven to be able to use a cell phone again (living in the age of cell phones as we do). Looks like I am back to not using a cell anymore, except for occasional texting. Probably best for my overall health anyway....so, all is well that ends well. (assuming they give me back my money).

 review/summary: Cant hear anything and people cant hear me
 review/text: This is a nice little Headset. Its small and light, you dont even know you are wearing it. But thats where the good things about it stop. The mircophone is not very sensitive, so when you talk to people, its a little difficult for them to hear you. Because of this, to get the voice dial to work, you have to yell the name at the Headset several times. Also the speaker is not very loud. When you are talking to someone else using this same Headset and you are also using this Headset you can hardly hear them and they can hardly hear you. This is because the speaker isnt very loud and the microphone isnt very sensitive, so it isnt very loud. Just bought a Plantronics M2500 Headset. While it is a little bit heavier and not as comfortable, the speaker and microphone are much better. The speaker is so loud, I dont even use it at the maximum setting, even when talking to someone that is using a Motorola HS820 Headset. Also the microphone is much more sensitive, people can hear me much better. They say I am much louder. I never have to say the name more than once in a normal voice with the voice dialing. The only thing with the Plantronics M2500 Headset is that you cant answer a call while on a call, which the Motorola HS820 Headset can do. Instead you have to answer through the phone instead. After using the Plantronics M2500 Headset for awhile I realize, its just not very comfortable. If I wear it for more than a few mins, it just starts to hurt my ear, also if you have small ears, it just wont stay on your ears. The design of the Motorola HS820 Headset is much more comfortable. I can wear it for hours and I dont even know its there. I am going back to using the Motorola HS820 Headset.

 review/summary: Extremely Pleased
 review/text: This is a great headset. It is extremely comfortable and feels secure. I love the fact that you flip down the microphone in order to turn it on. I no longer dial my husband without realizing that my headset is on (much to his pleasure and mine). The voice quality sounds extremely good. I never have to ask the caller to repeat themselves. I've listened to myself talking on the headset by calling my home recorder and it sounded the same as when I call home and speak directly into my phone.I often use it in the car and no one has complained about not being able to hear me. The volume buttons are easy to access, and I love the hand-free prompt. It was very easy for me to pair with my phone and learn how to use this headset.If you're like me and have studied these things to death trying to decide which will be the best for you, then I wouldn't hesitate to tell you to "just go for it". You'll be glad you did.

 review/summary: Great at first, but not durable
 review/text: I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work.

 review/summary: Works Good Enough for Me, Except the Voice Command Part!
 review/text: This review is for;Motorola H700 Bluetooth HeadsetI had this Bluetooth for over two years now and I have been very satisfied with it. I got a Bluetooth in response to California's mandatory hand's free law while driving. I only use this Bluetooth when I'm driving. The unit fits real well to my ears. If I get a call it beeps and I press it once to answer & once to hang up. Simple! I can also press the unit once to redial. My only complaint about this unit is the voice commands don't exactly work perfectly for me. As a Filipino-American I have a lot of ethnic names in my phone's directory so if I use voice commands on my Bluetooth to call a name with a complex pronunciation it often attempts to calls someone else in error. I suppose if my phone directory had simplified names like "home", "work" or "school" I would probably use my voice commands more frequently. Not sure if the voice command is just an issue with my specific phone the LG EnV, but for now I just keep it simple and only use the Bluetooth for answering the phone or re-dialing while driving so my hands can be kept on the more important task of driving safely.

 review/summary: First Blackberry... I was also changing carrier.
 review/text: Before I order this phone through Amazon, I went to a local store to see it first. I recommend this, because you can feel, see and test the phone to see if you like it. I really like the pearl and this is my first Blackberry. There are many new things to learn about the pearl and I am finding new things about the pearl everyday. The sure type takes a while to get use to. I love the size, weight and the vivid colors of the screen. The phone is compact, so if you have big fingers, it would not work out. You will also need to purchase a separate Mirco SD memory card if you want to upload MP3 songs and ring tones or take pictures etc... More updates to come about the phone.Pearl is 5 stars.As for T-mobile service. The service is great and the customer service is really good. I was switching from another carrier and I wanted to keep my number. When you sign a new contract, Amazon gives you a preset phone number. What I did is, I called T-mobile and they were able to switch over and I was able to keep my old number. If there was something that a consumer wants, T-mobile will do their best to accommodates.T-mobile is 5 stars.

 review/text: I bought this phone for my 72-year old mom. It is very easy to use and my mom easily learned the basic operations. The only problem is the volume switch located at the side and most of the time it is moved and needs to be readjusted. The big plus is she accidentally placed the phone with her laundry and laundered it for the full cycle and the phone still works!

That is, my lightsaber hilt is easily and quickly placed and removed. Also it works with the two belts I tried it with. If there is one complaint it's that it came in a plastic bag and not the actual packaging. But I didn't order it for the packaging, I wanted the Covertec WIPS spare belt clip and that works just fine. So I am very satisfied.

 review/summary: Cheap, but good quality and durable
 review/text: I guess not so many people would consider buying anything like this unit since a regular charger is more than enough usually. Well, one of the Razr's in my house could not longer charge the battery within the cell phone. This put me on the market to search for a unit like that. By the way, I tried different battery as well and different phones with no luck, so I really had to charge the battery externally.When this unit arrived, I quickly realized that this is SO MUCH BETTER than the regular charger, b/c it shows the battery level accurately, while charging, while my cell phones (both) don't do that. It also looks a lot more nicer on the desk or over visible place than a crappy generic charger. All-in-all, I now can charge a battery and the second cell phone. I used it for about a year now and it still works.The only downside it is NOT dual voltage, 115V only - so it will not work, while traveling to Europe or other 220V country.

From what I could judge the sound quality is good too. I bought the phone for its price and prepared to get a primitive model. But I got much more.Cons: the buttons are really inconvenient and difficult to press. The ringtones are strange.

 review/summary: Great reception but need improvement on certain things
 review/text: I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:1) phone card calling feature. This phone doesn't include Phone card calling. So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book. This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway. For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky. All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact. This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls. My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature. All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".2) Low volume on regular answering. In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece. You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume. Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.

 review/summary: This is not a phone that I would ever buy again.
 review/text: I have had this phone a little over a year. I live in rural Missouri and have had a hard time getting any technology where we live. This phone has been okay for me. Not a great phone, but just okay. I really am looking forward to upgrading to a new phone. But like I said, I would never recommend this phone or ever buy it for myself, again.Pros:1) I have 5 bars most of the time since getting Cingular and this phone. So I don't know if it is the service or the phone that is making it better.2)The camera phone works adequately for the basic camera that it is.3)I have not had any real technical problems with this phone other than dropped calls. And I have just learned to live with that.4)(And I hope that it is the service and not the phone that is giving me the five bars.)Cons:1)Every time I pick up the phone, I accidentally hit the volume and/or camera button on the side.2)A lot of dropped calls. The other day, I had it sitting beside me when my home phone rung. I answered it and it was my mother asking why I did not pick up the call on my cell. She had just called and left a voice message. Sure enough, I checked and there it was. I couldn't believe that I did not hear it ring!3)The volume is never loud enough.

 review/text: I've had mine several years. Pro: It takes a beating! From dropping it to spilling coffee on it, it still works. Great to have so much in one item. The handwriting recognition is great, it really works.Con: The mp3 player is not loud enough, I can still hear people talking around me, even with the volume all the way up. Battery life is terrible. Phone never actually rings, it keeps re-setting itself for no ringer. It also keeps turning itself on, and when I'm listening to music, keeps beeping. The sound quality on the speaker phone is awful, and there's no way I'm going to ba able to get the headphone plugged in in time for a phone call. I hate that you have to use the headphones or speaker phone, you can't just use it like a regular phone.It may have some cool features but I would not buy it again.

 review/summary: Correction to "Won't fit w760a phone. Pins wrong." My fault.
 review/text: My initial review was wrong:"Looks like the right plug, but didn't fit a Sony Ericsson w760a phone as advertised. Stems align, but not the pins. w760a doesn't have holes for the 3 pins, as it expects simple contacts. Tried making contact but nothing registered on the phone. How hard is it to get the compatible models right? Get what you pay for I guess ($2.51)."Updated review after I took some time to look things over:Took a look at my charger adapter pins and realized they were the same style as this USB adapter. The pins actually fit just fine between the contacts. Just requires a little force to get the adapter plastic stems attached (and more force removing it). However, the results were perfect and the procedure simple. After connecting the USB to my desktop, Adobe software on my PC kicked in and all I had to do was browse for a directory to store my photos and videos. Couldn't have been more pleased that this cheap adapter worked so well and as advertised. So I did get my money's worth and then some.

 review/summary: Got battery?
 review/text: The instructions are the only thing that kept me from given this item a five. This cable works great for communicating with my PC. I am able to directly access anything on my phone's M2 memory expansion card as well as backup and restore all my contacts. You know how important this is if you ever lost a phone with 5 years of collected phone numbers.We have fairly new phones and a new PC. After leaving my phone attached with this cable to my mew PC for several hours I assumed it had charged because it did in the past from my old PC. I disconnected the cable and my phone went dead when I tried to use it. At first I thought my battery may have gone bad, so I switched it with one in a spare phone kept charged on an AC wall adaptor for emergencies. My phone worked fine and the dead battery, now in the spare phone, charged in short order. I switched the batteries back and everything was OK.I discovered if my phone is charged with this cable from a PC or a laptop instead of a car or wall adaptor it must be attached to a USB port or a powered hub capable of supporting higher low-battery-state charging current. If the USB port is not designed to provide the necessary power, it turns off and on to protect itself. This may or may not be a problem if the battery is fully charged when connected. I have not tested that yet. On my phone, if a USB port used is underpowered, it cycles "CHARGING" off and on in the display.It would be nice if this information and a warning were prominently displayed in the instructions. I also found the downloadable software from Sony Ericsson was really all that was required. The instructions made initial setup unnecessarily complicated.

 review/summary: Well made cable
 review/text: If you want to put stuff on your Sony Ericsson phone via your computer, this is right cable. First of all, it's much cheaper than the official one. Because of that, I wasn't expecting much, but when I received it, I was surprised at how well made the cable is. The cable is fairly thick, and whether it's the wire itself or just the shielding, it won't break easily. Once I finally hooked it up, I had no problems with my computer picking up the phone after getting into USB mode. Of course, finding the right mode on the phone to be able to transfer content was a different story. Anyway, I used it a few times and haven't had any problems with it. Highly recommended to SE phone owners looking for a USB cable.

 review/text: I wanted a phone mainly for voice, and text messaging. I bought an unlocked phone so I didn't have to deal with any rigmarole at a phone store. I just slipped my SIM card in. I don't use the browser and I wasn't interested in a camera, which this phone doesn't have. The phone works very well. It seems to take several clicks to navigate around so perhaps that could be a bit more efficient (the reason for a 4 not a 5). The sound quality and reception are as good as they can be, battery life is fantastic compare to my older phone, and it is comfortable to use.

 review/text: I originally tried the Motorola headset & returned it because it was too floppy on my ear. But I love this LG because it has an earbud that fits into your ear & stays very secure & is comfortable. Sound quality is good on both ends - loud enough for me plus sounds good to others. The other nice thing about this product is it's compatibility. I use it with my LG VX8600 & am able to use the same car charger for both the phone & headset - very convinent!!! I would suggest this product - it works great!!!

 review/summary: This battery did not fit in my CU400 phone
 review/text: Although physically the same size as the original battery, it is notched differently. The original battery has a single notch and this battery has two notches which don't line up with the phone tab. Since the electrical connections looked the same, I modified the phone tab to make it fit but it would not charge. There must be some internal difference as well.I bought two batteries and tried them both and they both acted the same. My first attempt to make it fit was to widen the notch on one of the batteries so I guess that would make it pretty hard to return???

 review/text: I've been aware of this product for a while, and had some friends highly recommend it to me. Not wanting to shell out all that money, I bought a cheaper alternative. After going through multiple $20-$30 inferior products, I realized that I should have just bought this to start with.I've owned this for several months now, and it's great. The range is excellent, and people on the other end say the quality is amazing. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the volume is a little low. I use this on a 2008 Mac Pro with Skype. Turning the volume in the application and on the headset all the way up, I wish sometimes that it would be a little louder. CS50 USB WIRELESS HEADSET FOR VOIP SOFTPHONES 200FT RANGE (CS50USB)

 review/summary: Flippin Problems with this model phone
 review/text: i850 2 wks after received--would power off everytime I closed it & also during calls. Sprint gave me HUGE hassel when trying to get it replaced. On phone with them 2:15 PM until 4:43 PM, went through LONG list of people who couldn't make a managerial decision and would transfer me to someone else or just keep me on hold extremely long time. One tried to sell me more expensive phone and telling me they DID NOT HAVE another i850 IN STOCK--I called back and another salesman said i850 was IN STOCK and did I want one. During final call I requested anyone in management and a lady finally took care of my call properly and 2-day expressed new phone, no charge.The aesthetic design and ease of use is lovely.The durability and value is LOUSY.I'll post again if replacement i850 is faulty as well.

 review/summary: THE WORST
 review/text: First of all, I'd like to say that I don't personally know anyone who's completely satisfied with Nextel, their phones, and their service. Dropped calls, frozen screens, random shut downs are regular occurances for a Nextel phone, and trust me, I've been through quite a couple of them. They all eventually break down. Anyone defending Nextel is probably working for them, or hasn't been with Nextel for over a year. We just purchased two of the i855 phones (our i830 had finally given out after less than 7 months) and one phone has already frozen and will not turn back on. In fact, at a restaruant the other day I over heard a woman stating that Nextel phones were built to break-down after a certain time (makes sense, the customer would need to buy another one). I assume the person on the other line asked her how she new such a thing because she responded "Well, I used to work for them." It's disgusting how they take advantage of their customers. After explaining the problems to customer services, they continue to bribe you with better, "newer" phones in exchange for the promise of a 2-year contract with them. Their service is horrible, and you're phone will eventually give you problems. I PROMISE THAT!

 review/summary: Best Phone Yet !!!
 review/text: I recently purchased this phone as an upgrade from my i95cl. This is a great phone. I've heard some people say on other review boards that it is big and bulky. I think they were writing about the WRONG phone.This phone is thin and lightweight (esp. compared to i95). Clarity is EXCELLENT. My calls sound like a landline phone and it is so great. The menus are easy to navigate.The only con I have about the phone is the rubber piece that covers the charger hole. Sometimes it is hard to open, especially when you need to access it quickly to plug your phone in. I'm sure after a couple of weeks I will get the hang of it and it will loosen up a bit to make it easier to open as well.This is a great phone and I'd recommend it to anyone! I'm so glad I upgraded. I just can't say enough good things about this phone and it's too many to mention.

 review/text: I purchased this for a vacation, where I was not sure how often I would be charging my 680. This appears to be a correct replacement for the original Treo 680 battery, and has worked OK for the last two weeks. (I was actually able to charge it regularly, so I used it consistently and relegated the original to use as a spare.)Note that this is *not* a genuine Palm battery - at least not the unit I received.So, based on limited use, this is a recommended alternative to the original 680 battery.

Best of all, it is small enough to fit in my pocket easily. The only thing other that I would mention is I bought two of these and one fit on the right ear and one fit on the left. I didn't think this was a big deal, it was just strange. I am going to buy another one for my dad.

 review/summary: good
 review/text: I have it coupled with my Mototrola Razr telephone. Sometimes turning it on resluts in it calling the first number with or without any instructions, and then it does not hang up easiliy by pressing the button which results in having to find the phone and openening it and then pressing the hangup button on the telphone iteself. This a dangerous procedure when driving and when one one must hang up the unwanted call.

 review/summary: I can't hear you!!!
 review/text: Like many who have reviewed this headset, I was initially very pleased with the ease of setup and the apparent ease of use. None of that mattered, though, the first time I tried to use it in my car. The hand I would normally have used to hold a phone to my ear is now occupied trying to press this Motorola headset against my ear tightly enough to have any chance of hearing the call. I would absolutely not recommend this headset for that reason.

 review/summary: Unless you have other iGo stuff, don't get this
 review/text: Igo went cheap on the design of this tip. It won't stay in the phone like the palm branded charger will. Works perfectly if you set the phone down, don't touch it and don't go over any bumps. I have other iGo stuff, so I live with it. If you need a charger just for your treo, stick with the oem one.UPDATE: After numerous complaints, iGo redesigned the tip. If you have an old one, they'll replace it. If you buy a new one, make sure it says rev.H, not rev.02. Not sure how H follows 2.

 review/summary: Great Audio, So So Microphone, A little Snug.
 review/text: The audio is full, deep, and rich. I listen to lots of types of music from classical and country to rock and hip-hop. No complaints, no distortion. Please note: Much of the quality depends on your computer's bluetooth drivers. I'm using Vista 64 bit with IO gear's bluetooth dongle. Vista's built in drivers are OK. However, the IO gear dongle comes with its own advanced drivers that let do things like fiddle with the sampling rate and the number of bits. Most people will more than likely be satisfied with the default settings.The microphone sounds like old speaker phones from the 90's: cavernous, reverberant, overly sensitive and echo-y. Don't even think about trying to hold a conversation with someone while in a crowded room. If this had boom mic, it would be excellent for phone calls and Skype. However, it would look ridiculous in public. Sony opted for better style instead of a better microphone. That said, I use this headset when I talk to people on Skype. It is adequate for Skype use.Battery life is exceptionally long. The manual says around it will last about 17 hours. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge a completely dead headset. The headset arrives with a dead battery. I've yet to have the headset batteries die on me. I put it on at work at the beginning of the day, keep em on for the entire work day, then plug them in at night.It's a tight snug fit borderline on tight. The ear cups could be larger. I have an unusually large mellon of a head. However, I have smaller than average sized ears. The cups press down a little too hard on my tiny ear lobes. I guess Japanese people have even smaller ears than I do, which I find hard to believe. An extra 1/2 inch in circumference would have made these puppies perfect. Unfortunately, they kinda hurt after a few hours of use. I've gone walking with the headset paired to my phone's radio without any fears of the headset falling off.It folds in on itself and comes with a travel pouch. Construction is sturdy, but it is still plastic. I believe it would survive a fall off the top of your head, but it might not survive getting stepped on or sat on.The volume buttons are a little too close to each other and hard to tell apart just by feeling. Still, you can get used to it. I sometimes still hit the forward/back lever instead of the volume buttons. I think the designers got it wrong, the lever should have been for the volume and the buttons should have been for skipping to the previous and next track.Am I happy with this product? Yes. If I had all the money in the world, would I buy these again? Probably not. If money was no object, I'd go for the Bose headphones or another Sony but one with a higher model number than this one.

 review/summary: Not really that good.
 review/text: I had several problems with it:1. Didn't fit my head really well, and the way it pushed my ears into the "slots" made them sore. It also just didn't feel that secure on my head.2. It paired fine, but it cuts out like I read on other reviews. I tried it on a laptop computer (Dell XPS 1330) along with a HTC Touch Pro. It cut out with both devices at random times.I really don't have any reason to rate this product over 1 star.However, I did buy the Sony Ericsson HBH-DS200 and that thing works great. I've never had it cut out and I pair it with the laptop and Touch Pro with no issues at all.

 review/summary: Impossible to upgrade to this phone???
 review/text: Even though there is an option on the web page to upgrade this phone, evidently you cannot. I purchased this phone as an upgrade. When I received the phone, I also received a new phone number and bill on my AT&T account. When we asked AT&T about this, we were told that we would have to speak to the seller. When we spoke to A-1, who sold this phone on Amazon, we were told that they were unable to do upgrades. They did go through the trouble of checking the website, and to their amazement, they were able to access the upgrade options as well. Even after this, they refused to treat my purchase as an upgrade so that I could keep my old phone number, or cancel the new phone number. We spent two hours working on this situation. Over and over we were told that our only options were to keep the phone and the extra phone line that came with it or send the phone back. We couldn't justify an extra phone line that we would not use, so now, the phone is back at A-1. My Amazon days are over. Why advertise, and allow somone to order something, in this case an upgrade, that they will not receive? Good-bye Amazon...

I get nothing but complaints from whomever i am talking with. I almost always have static also, i can have the phone on my lap and still have static. I never have the phone far from the bluetooth. It's a pricey little bugger too! So one would assume the quality would be good, but its not. I also work for a retail cellular company and i see this headset returned over and over. Also many of my associates have the complaint about this product. If you want great sound go get your self a jawbone headset!!

 review/text: I hear lots of static, even before making a call. I have Motorola H500 too, and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300). This H700 has LOTS of static. Called Motorola tech support, and their best solution is to return and replace it. As far as usability goes, this a great headset, over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug. I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise. While I hear static, people on the other phone can hear me fine, just as good as when I'm using H500.

 review/text: Overall this one of the more comfortable headsets I've owned and I think its more stylish than most available.However, the sound quality is terrible. While talking on this you always sound like you are far away in a tunnel. It is just never as loud as talking on the phone normally; plus listening can be quite difficult, especially in the car. The headset claims to have noise cancellation, but it does not seem to make a difference. If your phone normally gets poor reception, the quality of this headset will amplify those problems both for talking and listening.I've owned 2 of these (returned the first one b/c quality was so bad) and know 2 other people with this headset; we've all had the same experiences.

 review/summary: Better than expected
 review/text: Having read the other reviews for this product, I expected to be disappointed. I am not. The sound is crisp and clear. I can hear better than with my blackberry hand set. No one has had a problem understanding me on the other end. I have had no problem with static or other interference. I have not used it far from the handset, generally I wear it when I'm driving, and the phone is within a few feet of me.

 review/text: The quality of this product is good, it's a little tough to put on, and even harder to take off. I have experienced the problem with the lock button cover and being a little tough, but since I use my phone so much it loosened up and since then has been fine. Good product overall, definitely a good buy!

 review/summary: Works great for me
 review/text: My extender arrived fast and was simple to install. I put it outside on a pole which extends above the highest point of my house. My phone showed one bar outside and no bars inside, now it shows 5 bars inside. The only problem is the phone must stay real close to the extender (4 or 5) feet, this works for me because my cell phones Blutooth talks to my Bluetooth Dock-N-Talk which has a five phone cordless set pluged into it. I don't move my cell or talk on it, I use the regular cordress phones which are in 5 different rooms.

 review/summary: Excellent, Negative reviews hogwash!!!!
 review/text: I have a summer home in a remote part of Indiana with many trees surrounding the house. I live on a back country dirt road. I do not know where the nearest cell tower is but I got no bars in the house, (could not make a call or use data connection). Outdoors, I had one bar and calls were come and go depending upon time of day.Per the instructions, I walked the perimeter around the house to find the strongest direction of signal with my cell phone.I purchased this product along with 50' extension cable and grounding kit, (grounding very important). I erected a 7', 2"dia. pvc pipe 7' above the peak of the roof (Note:***you can not use a metal standard) I was unable to get above the tree line. I used a 2"dia. pipe to make it stronger against storms. I suppose I could have gotten by with 1-1/4", but wanted to be safe. I fastened the antenna to the pole with wire ties. I then ran the wire across the roof and down the side of the house to the grounding bracket, (which I grounded via a metal water spiget on outside of house). This is essential for an exterior installation. I created a "drip" loop at entrance hole to house, (any loops made in the installation must be no less than 4" across, measuring from one side to the other).Once inside the house I made the connection to the unit. Their are lights on the unit to give you information about the unit. I am receiving mostly a green light that sometimes turns yellow. However, I NOW GET 3-4, (THREE TO FOUR) CONSISTANT BARS INSIDE THE HOUSE!!!!! I am also now able to use my data connection with the same signal strength!!! I have no more missed or dropped calls. My cell carrier is AT&T; and my data carrier is Verizon. It works great with both. You MUST follow the directions to the letter. If you do, these are the results. Be patient. Experiment with placement of the base unit to get the best signal throughout the house. Good luck!Wireless Extenders YX510-PCS-CEL Dual-Band Cell Phone Signal Booster

 review/text: Afetr four years, the battery in my wife's LG (Verizon) cell phone was getting a tad long of tooth. It would hold a charge for a day, but not much longer. I ordered this battery with my fingers crossed. I expected to have to reform it when it arrived, going through a few full charge/discharge cycles before it hold a charge for long. I slapped the battery in the phone and it was on the charger only 10 minutes or so before it showed fully charged. To my surprise, it held the initial charge for over 9 days! Well done.

 review/summary: Great for Motorola ear buds
 review/text: This review is for the X-small case. I purchased this for my Katana DLX, however, it turned out to be too small. I could not fasten the velcro tab. So many of the cell phone cases are too big. I have since used it for my ear bud. The small ear bud case for the motorola ones have been reviewed as being so small that the center button is depressed while in it. I ordered a zippered ear bud case to solve the problem. I use to put just the bud in a zippered part of my purse but often needed to put other things there too and was afraid of it being ruined. I also had it slide out of a purse pocket unnoticed on to the floor of the car. I saw it a day or two later. Hence, my search for a case colorul enough to reckonize quickly. This phone case turned out to be no larger than the harder bud case and attaches to the handles of my purse. Does it look great? No. But it does stay securely inside the case and the case does stay securely attached to the handle of my purse which happens to be a casual nylon one for carting around for everyday use. This way it is readily available. I no longer have to hunt for it in my purse! If I forget to put it on before I start driving, it is a simple matter to rectify. This really helps make life simpler for one grandmother taking care of young school age grandchild. Things get hectic enoungh with school dropoffs and pickups with errands inbetween!

 review/text: The HP 6315 should never have been released. It is unstable and has to be soft rebooted about once a day but the big problem is the cell phone. T-mobile is the carrier but I believe it is the 6315 that is the problem as we have no problems with two other Tmobile phones in the same places. Worst of all the phone shuts down on it's own and you don't know it until you look at it. I thought I had a bad unit until I checked the web users forums for the hp 6315 and saw that everyone else also had these problems and other problems I had not noticed yet.Stay far away from this wreck.

 review/summary: Adorable - It's a SONY!
 review/text: I bought this phone in April and I must say don't buy a phone on looks alone. Though I love the phone the most annoying thing is I get almost to no signal anywhere inside buildings and sometimes outside the phone will just cut out due to no signal.Besides the signal problem this phone is great - mine came with a free bluetooth headset and 2 free face plates, one of which is furry to touch. You can buy faceplates separately, which is a nice change to only Nokia phones getting them.The phone itself has many settings and allows you to go on the Internet and download songs, sounds, themes, music, games, videos and much more.Some things that are special to this phone include changing how the light glow around the phone, a MusicDJ, a VideoDJ, PhotoDJ, world clock, remote control, media player, camera and infrared port.You have other average settings like calendar, alarms, scheduler, themes, master reset, sound recorder, tasks, notes, synchronization, timer, stopwatch, calculator, code memo, profiles, language, shortcuts, speed dial, silent mode, key sound, wallpaper (internal & external), screensaver and brightness.Overall it's a great little phone and I'd recommend it to my friends.

 review/summary: Excellent phone!
 review/text: I got the Sony Ericsson phone yesterday and it 100% better than the Motorola RAZR, which I am returning today and would never recommend to anyone.RAZR only offers 3 ring tones (stingy!), the speaker volume is low, the handset volume is also low, even when I tune the volume to max.Sony has lots of ring tones, speaker and handset volume are much louder, can take picture with phone closed, AND it can take videos too.Also, Sony's phone is much easier to user, consider that my father who doesn't know English couldn't memorize the basic functions in RAZR but easily learned the same features in the Sony.Cingular now offers the Sony phone for cheap, so anyone spending a lot of money on the RAZR is just throwing $$ in the trash. RAZR is full of hot air with some style and zero substance.Sony phone is smaller & cuter (the thickness is just a little more than the thickness of my Samsung phone), easier to handle, overall design is more user friendly, and offers more features.I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but I'm sure it'll be just fine.

When you first flip open the phone, the screen blips for a second but is okay. The backgrounds that work for the main screen and outside screen are nice, and the antenna is much cooler than the original ones. It has nice features and pretty good in the menu category, although some of the features are hard to find in the menus. The battery life is wonderful and the changeable plates are nice, too! All in all, a pretty good phone.

I have accidentally pressed them a couple of times, especially the camera button, but nothing has happened. In fact, if you just press the camera button, it doesn't do anything. In order to use the camera button, you must press and hold it. The volume button don't seem to get in the way. Of course, my Motorola phone had side buttons as well, so perhaps I'm just use to it.Signal on this phone is great. It stays at full strength in areas where the Motorola V551 would go up and down. Voice quality is excellent. I am able to hear people great and vice versa. The speaker phone is exceptional. I can switch to the speaker phone in the middle of the conversation, and the person I'm talking to hardly notices. It's much better than the speaker phone on the Motorola V551.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good camera phone with bluetooth capabilities.

 review/summary: Good phone, but annoying camera button and bad antenna design
 review/text: The phone works great. I've been getting service in places that my old cell phone has been unable to. The menu is very easy to understand and simple to navigate -- it's very well laid out and even the novice user can pick up how to use it easily.There are only two things that I found at fault with the phone:- As everyone else has stated, the camera button is extremely sensitive and gets turned on all of the time by accident.- While the neat looped antenna looks aesthetically pleasing, it's slightly annoying because it leans backwards slighty towards the back of the phone. When you lay the phone flat on its back, it cannot lay flat because the antenna is leaned back so much. This is no big deal when it's just laying on the table, but when I have it in the pocket of my pants, especially when I'm wearing tight fitting pants, the looped antenna is sticking out the backside of the phone, which makes carrying it in my pocket rather uncomfortable.But aside from those two things, it's a nice phone that works great and gets great reception.

 review/summary: Excellent little phone. Does everything it's supposed to!
 review/text: First of all, I don't know what planet this "lookoutguy" comes from but the phone and the service are top notch. I am on the month to month plan and I absolutely love it! THERE ARE NO HIDDEN CHARGES!!! Repeat THERE ARE NO HIDDEN CHARGES!!!There was no activation fee either. Just put money in your account and start using the phone. This is the most versatile phone/plan I have ever had. The phone itself is really nice. The camera part takes suprisingly good photos. It even has a zoom option with a flash. All my calls have sounded crisp and clear. The one thing I love most about this little gem is the schedule function in the tools section. I use this feature everyday and it is a nice bonus. I also like using the downloadable ring tones. I can see why this phone is so popular with the teens but I am middle aged and love it too! You can't go wrong with this phone/plan.

 review/summary: Perfect solution
 review/text: I had heard about this product on the radio and decided to do a little research on it. I went to Amazon and read some reviews. Some good, some bad. My biggest concern was going to be noise reduction while driving. I purchased the product for my husband who drives a diesel truck for work purposes (and he also likes to drive with his windows down!) so for him it was important for him to be able to hear and have the other party be able to hear him as well. He wasn't into the little ear pieces for hands free. This was the perfect solution! He has no complaints about this product! It has clear sound, the microphone works well, it is easy to connect to. I am considering one for myself!

 review/summary: Great Battery Life
 review/text: I really like the BlueAnt Supertooth light. I have been looking for a handsfree speakerphone for my car for some time. I am not the type to wear a bluetooth in my ear at all times and frankly the hassle of putting one on/off every time I entered and exited my car was a hassle. The visor clip works great. It is easy to take off the clip if I need, such as to recharge. I only recharge the device once a week, and I leave it on most of the time. The battery life is great. Sound quality is very, very good. I get no complaints from people I call.

 review/summary: Worked with no fuss
 review/text: I live in CA, so the new hands free cell phone use while driving is going into effect soon. I dont want to look like a dork by using a bluetooth earpiece (yes you do! you are in denial if you say you dont), so this looks like a good comprimise.I took it out of the box and examined that indeed it does look pretty with the glossy finish. So finger smudges showed as soon as I got my hands on it. I charge it up and when the charge LED turned green I went ahead and followed the instructions to sync it with my LG9000 envy cell phone. There was no pain in doing this.I took it to the car and installed the clip on the visor. My visor was kind of thick so it took some bending, but in the end it clipped on to the visor ok. I made my first call using the voice command and it went without a hitch. The sound is loud enough for me to hear and my wife reported she could hear me ok.Then I turned on the GPS on my phone, and used the BlueAnt as a speaker for the turn by turn directions because I found the speakers on my phone to be weak. So this has saved the function of the phone as before I had trouble listening to the instructions through the phone tiny speakers.So in the end, I am very happy with it, and it save my look by not wearing an earpiece. Thanks BlueAnt.

 review/summary: Handsfree and safe
 review/text: I bought this Blue Ant so that I could comply with the new California law that it is illegal to use your cell phone while driving, unless you are using a handsfree device. In addition, I bought a cell phone holder that clips to my air vent, so my phone (Motorola RAZR) is clipped on and open while I drive. This way, I can see on my screen who is calling if I do receive a call. The sound quality is decent, and it is so much more convenient and more comfortable than wearing the bluetooth headset. I like it.

 review/summary: Amazon.....I'm disappointed
 review/text: I've been shopping with Amazon for years and I have never had a problem before. I own an LG VX3300 and my battery was dying...at one point, when I put tried to charge it, my battery was so dead that the phone couldn't even recognize that a battery was installed. Didn't want to cough up the $40 Verizon wanted for a new one, so I decided to try Amazon. To my complete delight, Amazon DID have my phone battery; the "Buy New" list price was $8.99 and I assumed that perhaps since my phone was so old (almost 2 yrs.) the battery was new but being sold at a closeout price.WRONG!!!I got the battery. NOT New. Nowhere on the product page does it mention that I would be purchasing a used or refurbished battery. I haven't tried the battery yet, but the only reason I made the purchase is because I was given the impression that I would be purchasing a new battery. I returned the battery (Amazon returns ROCK!) and got a replacement the next day, but guess what???? I got another used/refurbished battery. My order was fulfilled quickly and the return was very smooth, but I still didn't get what I asked for.Amazon, my only beef with you is that the product page needs to specify that the consumer is purchasing a used/refurbished battery. I'll still continue shopping with you because you're an awesome service, but I'll buy my cell phone accessories elsewhere.

 review/summary: EXCELLENT SERVICE, EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED!!! :-)
 review/text: Hi everyone. I ordered 1 LG standard battery for my Verizon VX3300 phone (which I've had since May 15, 2006, but STILL works like a charm). My battery was dying out, lasting, at most, only a few minutes on a FULL CHARGE (typical for having the same battery for 3 - 3 & 1/2 years). Instead of purchasing a NEW phone, or a NEW battery at a mall, store, etc., I figured I'd try out Webtreo. I CANNOT stress enough what EXCELLENT service Webtreo provides! I'm EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED!!! :-) The battery was only $5.73 + $2.98 (for delivery), totalling a mere $8.71. It only took about 2 or 3 days to reach me, from California to New Jersey -- and it was BRAND NEW, in PRISTINE condition and it works GREAT! Yes, if you're looking for a replacement battery, I HIGHLY encourage you to do business with Webtreo; you WON'T be disappointed. ;-)

 review/text: Bought this battery as a backup for my LG8300. Fits perfectly, is an LG brand battery as opposed to a OEM-like battery for about the same price on ebay. Charged the battery to full capacity and had it in my travel bag for 3 weeks. took it out when my phone ran out of juice and it was fully charged and ready to keep me talking.

 review/summary: Used Battery Sold As " New"
 review/text: I too read reviews from other buyers complaining that they received a used product. I was scepital since all my other transactions with Amazon has been flawless. I ordered two batterys and received these today. I opened the box and found one battery out of the package laying in the bottom of the box while the other battery was still in it's package. I inspected the batterys and both were scratched and showed signs of wear on the battery itself. The contact were scratched and discolored which could only happend if the batterys were used or recycled. What a dissapointment!I hope that Amazon would listen to the complants of there customers and address the problem with there supplier. I am returning the product today. I Like using Amazon because of the great service I have received in the past but next time, I will pay close attention to feedback given by other customers.

 review/text: I bought three batteries. None of them have very good battery life. One had battery life less than 24 hours of idle time and in fact had shorter life than the 2 year old one that I was trying to replace. To add insult, when I emailed for an RMA to exchange it, I didn't even get a reply. I don't believe these are new batteries. If they are, they perform very poorly.

 review/summary: Easy to pair, very good wireless stereo sound
 review/text: I bought these to pair with my Samsung P2 music/video player. The pairing was easy and all of the features work well with the P2 except I can not change the equalizer settings on the P2 when paired and P2 does not support FM radio with Bluetooth.The sound quality is very good (not too much bass) and great for a wireless headset but not in the league of the Shure earbuds that I have or the Bose Quiet Comfort 1 (both which cost significantly more than the Jabra). Listening to music or watching videos in places where wires are problematical --- as well as those who exercise with a music player --- these an easy buy, espcically at the price of $38+ dollars.I don't use these with my cell phone as I use a Jawbone for my cell. For some reason the Jabra paired with my computer but I am not sure why I can not get sound. Dell's Bluetooth module has always been problematical, so I will assume it is the computer and not the Jabra.

 review/text: This phone is simply amazing. I'm not a gadget freak & use the phone to make err... phone calls rather than using a multitude of features. The design & finish on this phone is amazing. Sound quality is excellent! Screen is very clear. Syncs very easily with Outlook etc. The sure type feature is very well done. Also note that there are no porting fees if you're new to Cingular/AT&T.;Finally,I bought the shield from shieldzone.com. It works like magic. I had a problem with all my other phones as I tend to keep it in the same pocket as my house key etc. Hence, all my phone got scratched pretty bad. But now with the little shield protecting my device, not a single itty-bitty scratch so far. Recommend the shield if you have the same scratch & paint chipping problem.

 review/text: I've used a lot of bluetooth headsets including some reputed to be the best like the Jabra 250. The iogear headset is almost as good and less than half the price. Mine paired quickly, has good sound quality and range and works quite well with my SE 610's voice commands. Battery life is very good and I like that I can charge it from my notebook with the include USB charging cable (as well as normal AC charger that is 110-240, important when I travel). I also find it very light and small. It is comfortable and easy to put on. The only problem I've noted is that if the phone is in a holster on my left side and the headset is on my right ear, my head seems to cause interference. Otherwise, a good headset at a very good price.

The additional, included, charging devices (battery and plugin) with the different compatible plugs is a plus when travelling. Easy to set up with your phone too.

 review/text: I absolutely LOVE this headset. It's comfortable, clear and loud enough (volume is adjustable). I've had this headset for a little over a year and now it's not as reliable as it once was. When I have an incoming call and hit the answer button on the headset....the headset doesn't always connect to the phone and it can be a real annoyance; and in my opinion a safety hazard while driving. Customer service isn't as accomodating as Motorola. My husband's Motorola died...he didn't have a receipt and it was a little over a year old. (Both model headsets were bought at the same time.) Motorola sent my husband(free of charge) a brand new headset while Plantronics did nothing for me. It's a shame because it's such a great product when fully operational. I still use it, but at times I need to turn it off and on to have it pick up calls. ....and yes, I deleted it from my phone and re-mated it thinking that would help. Oh and one more thing....it's fantastic when using on a motorcycle. The noise/wind reduction is incredible.

 review/summary: Plantronics Voyager 510 is Highly recommended.
 review/text: I bought this unit to replace a Motorola H300 Bluetooth headset. The 510 is more comfortable to wear and more secure on the ear. If you wear glasses like I do you may have to make some adjustments to fit both the 510 and your glasses earpiece over the ear. The on/off button is difficult to use, but if you have a good fingernail you'll get along fine. The 510 Bluetooth connects instanty with my Motorola Razor phone as soon as it is turned on. This is in sharp contrast to my Motorola H300 Bluetooth Headset which takes 5 to 10 minutes of fiddling around before the Bluetooth connects when first turned on.The noise reduction technology seems to work well. Since I use it in the car at normal highway speeds, often on course pavement, there is road and wind noise to content with. I've asked my friends if they could hear any of the road noise and they said, "No."The volume control seems to work well, although I don't need to use it much.I mainly judged the 510 on clarity of sound, comfort and the speedy Bluetooth connection. It rates high marks on the things I care about most.

 review/summary: Great headset!
 review/text: Cool headset! Nice design, very comfortable to use, great sound quality. Exactly what I was looking for. I've used it for about 2 months and works fine. The only problem that I have is that I can't attach it to 2 devices at the same time, as the specs indicate. I have connected it to my cell phone and also wanted to use with skype but if it's attached to one device, it's not recognized from the other one until I disconnect the first one.Besides this, I recommend it and I also recommend you to buy the carrying case.

 review/summary: Good Bluetooth Headset
 review/text: I wanted to pick up a bluetooth headset from quite some time and finally decided on the plantronics voyager 510. Pretty solid headset. Good sound clarity. I havent tested the distance though. I got disconnected a couple of times but that is not a big issue as my call durations last for quite sometime. Pretty good talk time and standby time as well. I could not get it to connect to my friend's nokia 2310. The nokia wouldn't discover it at all. I don'tknow what the reason is. But it has not given me any problems as such. The only problem is it is little big for a bluetooth headset. Could have been smaller.

 review/text: I have owned two of these so far, the work really good in all areas except for charging. The power connector does not fit into the ear piece very well, have to play with it to get it to charge, then the make part of the ear piece broke off. I like the unit except for the problem with charging.

 review/summary: Excellent quality and sound
 review/text: Prior to purchasing this headset, I had a Motorola that I was not happy with at all because it did not stay in/on my ear and the sound quality was poor.I am very happy with the Plantronics in the several months that I have had it now. It is small, stays put in my hear, has excellent audio quality and range. It works great with my Razor.My only complaint about the headset is the extremely small power button (which is also used as the mute button). If it was simply the power button, I would be ok with its size, but if you want to mute the headset, finding and pressing this button during a conversation is difficult at best.

 review/summary: Plantronics 510
 review/text: Originally tried Motorola HS820 with my Motorola E815 phone. Was happy with it at first. I liked the way it fit on my ear and it was easy to use. However, everytime I used it, the person on the other end would complain about hearing an echo. I tried turning the volume on the handset and headset down, but could not make it go away. I finally concluded that it would be useless if the person I was talking to couldn't tolerated the echo.I read reviews on many different headsets, but most of them had complaints about 'echos'. I really wanted to get a Motorola headset so the chargers for my phone and headset would be compatible. However, based on the reviews I read, I gave up on the Motorolas and tried the Plantronics 510.I've had my 510 for about a month now and am very happy with it. The sound quality is great. I don't believe the person on the other end knows if I'm talking on the handset or headset. I've had a couple complaints of an echo when I was talking to someone who normally speaks fairly loud. I had the headset volume louder than it needed to be. Once I turned to volume down a tad, they said the echo went away. This headset is definitely louder than the Motorola - probably because of the way the earbud fits in your ear (which is probably why the echo isn't a problem - the sound from the earbud doesn't reach the microphone). I still prefer the way the Motorola fit on my ear and the way the buttons felt. The buttons on the 510 aren't as easy to use, but they are tolerable. In the end, the sound quality is probably most important and the 510's is great.

 review/summary: Great in the Car Terrible when walking.
 review/text: I bought this item because of all the positive reviews here on Amazon, but I'm might send it back. I need a hands free set because of the new driving law in California, and wanted one for walking as well. For some reason when I use the headset in my car I can have my phone in my pocket or on the dash or where-ever and it works great, but if I am walking and have the phone in my pocket or even in my hand with my arm straight it the signal breaks up. I basically have to hold the phone up to the headset which defeats the purpose of having a headset!I have had similar trouble with an older motorola headset so I don't know if it is my phone or this product.The fit and functionality are good. Although it is a little bigger than I expected, it is comfortable and easy to use. It synced with my Sony Ericsson w580i with little effort. I may try to borrow some different headsets to see if they all have the same problem outside of the car before I decide whether or not to send this one back.

 review/text: My first bluetooth headset for my pocket pc was the Motorola HS850. I saw good reviews and thought it would be a good buy. After several months, I had to get rid of it. I simply couldn't hear people while driving. The ear piece sits outside the ear canal. I then purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510 and have been very pleased. It sits IN the ear canal so volume is good. It is comfortable and easy to put on and take off. I have had it for about 6 months and am very pleased.

 review/summary: Good unit, but not if you wear glasses
 review/text: This is my first BT unit which I bought to replace my wired headset. Incoming and outgoing voice quality is very good, nobody seems to know that I am using a BT headset. Loudness on both sides is also very good. Sometimes I hear a little echo of my own voice and a little static, but nothing major.The problem that I have with this unit is that it that the part that loops around your ear is rather large. When I am wearing my glasses, the loop on the headset sits on top of the loop of my glasses, therefore the headset does not sit properly and is not secure. In addition, I find this unit hard to put on with one hand because of the bulky ear loop; I didn't have this problem with my wired headset.To summarize:- Good voice quality- Comfortable (if you don't wear glasses)- Difficult to put on with one hand- Poor fit for people who wear glasses

 review/summary: Fantastic!!
 review/text: I love it! The volume in the earpiece is so loud I had to turn it down halfway (that is a good thing!) The incoming sound is clear and everyone that talked to me said I was crystal clear. I am extremely pleased.

 review/text: This was one of my best purchases of late. I have small ears and most over the ear bluetooths are too large for me. This one fits and the sound quality is excellent.

 review/summary: Love this bluetooth headset..
 review/text: I bought this about a week ago, its my first bluetooth headset and have been able to successfully pair it with my T-mobile MDA and also my husband's SDA. The Pairing was so easy and it works really well with both the phones. Sound quality is very very good, have not heard any echos or static so far. The headset is light in weight and does not sit heavy on the ears. I can turn off the headset when not in use and turn it back on and my phone picks it up rightaway. I bought this product after reading all the reviews at amazon and I have no regrets. I will definitely recommend this one, awesome headset.

 review/summary: Good Connection but a bit bulky
 review/text: I've had this Headset for about a year and its impressed me in that I haven't lost it. The connection is clear and the signal is strong. The only thing about it that I lost one of the ear buds to it and now I have another one which is a bit uncomfortable, at least initially, but then you get used it. I would recommend this set because it's not too small and not too big.

 review/summary: Unreliable phone
 review/text: I have had many problems with this phone and with Cingular service. Sometimes, when my friends call, they do not get my voice mail, they do not get ringing- they get dead air (or sometimes one of those evil prerecorded messages like Message GL 23 blah).As for the phone itself, it developed this problem of the sound going out. The person I was talking to could hear me, but I had complete silence from them. Then if I tapped the phone or made a noise, the sound would come back (so obviously, this was not just me having the volume down too low). The reception is also terrible in my area of Central Florida with this phone.I got a different phone (Nokia 3595) and it has worked a lot better so far. Much better reception in my area, none of those sound problems.Overall, I was very disappointed with this Ericsson phone. I had the T60d before and it always worked really well, but the T226 just is not very good.

 review/summary: good, compact phone
 review/text: I've had my T226 phone for a couple weeks so far and I have had nothing to complain about. Reception in Fresno and LA has been very good. The phone is very light and compact, it easily fits in my pants pocket. Checking the weather forecast and sports scores is quite easy, an unexpected bonus. The only downside that I have observed is that in bright sunlight the color screen can be difficult to read.This phone is being used with Cingular Wireless.

 review/summary: No Problems After a Year
 review/text: I've read lots of bad reviews of this phone used with the AT&T Network but I've had no problems using it with Cingular. The phone does indeed appear cheaply made (the look of the plastic they used is unfortunate) but apparently looks can be deceiving as it's taken all kinds of abuse over the last year and I've had no problems. The color display is so-so but I've enjoyed using the free software from the Sony Ericcson website to turn my photos into wallpaper. The ringtones are nice and can be uniquely assigned to contacts in your phonebook. Most importantly though, reception is excellent everywhere I use the phone and standby time is absolutely amazing (greater than 2 weeks.) The phone was free with my plan and I have no major complaints.

 review/summary: Great phone, but sorry speaker phone...
 review/text: Great phone, but has its defects. I mainly purchased this phone because it's a flip phone with a speaker phone (I get tired holding the phone up to my ear, and I hate ear pieces). By my experience and of two other owners of the same phone, the speaker phone works poorly. You can hear the caller talking nice and loud but they cannot hear you. Most of the time I had to turn off the speaker phone and just use it normally. I took my phone phone back in exchange for the Sanyo 4500 hoping it doesn't have the same problem. If you plan to buy this phone for the speaker as I did, save your time and money and look for another phone. If speaker phone is not of an essence to you, than this phone is great!
