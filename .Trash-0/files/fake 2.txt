 review/text: For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product.

 review/summary: Good, but...
 review/text: It does exactly what it says. you can browse and save your phone files (pictures, recorded sounds, Bluetooth acquired files) to your PC. You can also update the firmware with "Sony Ericsson Update Service". It can charge your phone but you need a charger connected to the dock for this.Now the bad part, it broke after just weeks of use and I didn't treat it harshly. It's just not working anymore and there's no sign of broken parts. Good while it lasted is all I can say. As with all electric devices, you can have better luck.

 review/summary: As far as FM Transmitters go, this one is best
 review/text: Buying an FM Transmitter can be a crap shoot because each one may work differently in each area and each vehicle. This one worked perfectly in my 04 Mustang on Frequency 88.7, but when I tried to use the same frequency in an 08 Silverado, it was very static-y. But I just changed the frequency to 88.3 and it worked perfectly again. I really like this product, especially because I had the Griffin iTrip before and that thing sucked on all levels. The only problem I have with this product is that it does not charge th iPod like others do, but I can deal with that.

 review/summary: PERFECT FEATURES FOR A CELL PHONE
 review/text: Thought:This phone comes with great features!! Unlike other phones, the T610 comes with features you wouldnt able to do with other phones. It also comes with infrared which you can hook up to other phones w/infrared or computer; with this feature you can send and recieve ringtones and pictures without being charged!Functions just like any other phone but more!The phone loads the menus very fast! faster then the Sony Ericsson T226 and other younger versions...The only problems is:Camera quality - yes, it does have poor camera quality, eventho the pictures you get from your computer or ordered are crystal clear, the camera is not clear. (strange how it supports over 63000 color but the camera is still weak)Voice Speaker - well this is not important to some people, i thought this cell phone has it all.Sound Recorder - it does what it does, but not high quality. When the recorded sound is played it is not loud enough. you got hold it up in your ear to hear some of it...Ringer - ok, im not sure about this but it seems like when i get a call, the ringtones doent play loud enough. My sisters phone (Samsung & NOKIA) ringers are very loud compare to the t610.Note- There are times when the phone malfunctions, im not sure if its t-mobiles technical difficulties or the phone itself. USUALLY its because of T-MOBILEs problems. if there problems with your T610 then just TURN it OFF and back ON. There so much features on this phone, you just wanna do everything at the sametime....Accessories:-the MP-10, this is the flasher for the t610. This flasher comes many features.-the Faceplates, change your look on the phone, it will look great.-the IrDA, the USB to infrared device for your computer, send and recieve pics,ringtones,games, and other information without being charged!!!! the 1# thing i love most!these are worth buying! BUY IT nOW!!!!OVERRALL: BEST Phone! some of my friends are buying this phone cause of its features and me showing it off hahhahhah!

 review/summary: Lousy phone
 review/text: I have had enough problems to last a lifetime I guess. I moved from Sprint PCS to T mobile (thinking that their Service was good). I think I was wrong in doing that.The Sprint service was working fine. My Sony Ericsson phone does not have any reception at all in my office & has a Lousy reception at home as well!!!!!!!!!!T Mobile sent me a replacement Phone & as well as the SIm card in the hope that their service would improve. Unfortunately (to my horror & utter dis-belief) the service is no better. The service is fine after I checked the SIm on my friend's phone which is a NOKIA. T Mobile refuses to replace the phone with the same features...I will have to shell a good amount of money as well....All in all SOny Ericsson T610 is not a good one. At best I can say that it is a good one by itself..but not for T Mobile I guess.

 review/text: After using about a dozen cell phones in the past 5 years I have found a phone I love to use. I get great reception (but it may be from switching from ATT Wireless to TMobile) and love the color display. My only two negatives about the phone is the keypad is a little small for my fat fingers (you should see me type on a full -size keyboard!). The other downside is the address book is a little hard to navigate (but that might be a learning curve on my part). I would feel very comfortable recommending this phone to a friend.

 review/summary: Sony Ericsson T610: great design, bad reception.
 review/text: First of all, I've used Sony Ericsson T610 with both Cingular and T-Mobile service and found them comparable in Los Angeles (Verizon is best here). From comparing all three phones (Nokia 6230, Sony Ericsson T610, and Motorola V551) with Cingular service, I've discovered that there is a *BIG* difference in phone reception quality.Phone reception quality is as follows: Nokia 6230 > Motorola V551 >> Sony Ericsson T610. The Sony Ericsson T610 had no reception in my apartment, the Nokia 6230 has great reception everywhere.Overall phone quality: Nokia 6230 > Sony Ericsson T610 >> Motorola V551. (Though if reception is most important, you might rank Motorola V551 over SE T610.)Here are pros/cons of Sony Ericsson T610:PROS:-Bluetooth: easy to sync contacts, photos, etc. w/PC, no additional software required => great.-Great battery life-Great display resolution, better than Nokia 6230.-Nice OS design: easy to navigate, easy to read menus, ex. "silent" is handy-Small, sleek, cool-looking, phoneCONS:-Bad reception!-Phone freezes sometimes. If turning on/off doesn't fix, try removing (and then re-inserting :) battery.-Sometimes keylock doesn't work and phone calls contacts.I recommend this phone if you have a good service provider for your area. It is cheap and easy to use. (Though, be wary of service providers locking the bluetooth. This hasn't happened to anyone I know, but I've heard that it's been a problem.) If I had reception in my apartment, I would have kept the T610 and sold the new Nokia 6230 on ebay.

 review/text: I will have to admit, this is my first headset to own and use. I researched a lot to find a headset that would be comfortable on my ear and have quality audio on both sides of the conversation. The Voyager 510 has all of this. It is however larger than most, if not all of the bluetooth headsets out on the current market. So if you don't mind a little larger headset, this is a great buy. It has great battery life and has a large radius to reach your bluetooth device. It currently works seamlessly with both my computer and Razer cell phone. To keep it protected, I got an old Altoids metal box, padded the inside, and I keep my headset in there when I am mobile.

 review/text: I bought this on a gold box special for $17.99. And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason.

 review/summary: Great for the car
 review/text: I got this to connect my phone to my car stereo. It's much easier to have hanging around than the one that comes with the phone. No microphone, so calls won't work, but you're in the car, so why should they?

 review/summary: Glitchy, bro.
 review/text: The adaptor frequently comes loose and easily loses connection with my phone. Pretty annoying for someone who simply wants to enjoy some music.

 review/summary: 100% Satisfied!
 review/text: What you see is what you get: a slick little accessory for the Sony Ericsson phone (in my case the W600i) that does exactly what it says does and is worth every penny! Shipping was fast and the customer service was terrific. I ordered two of these, because I thought at this ridiculously low price there was a good chance they didn't work well (if at all)--I was wrong, they work GREAT! And as an added bonus, the company sent me 4 of them and only charged me for 2! Great company, great product...I definitely recommend them.

 review/summary: Works well, but doesn't last long.
 review/text: This device is dirt cheap, which makes it worth buying because you can get several of them. You'll need them too, because they don't last very long. I've gone through about 4 of them over the last 2 years so you should expect about 6 months out of it. The sound quality is good and there doesn't seem to be any interference while it's still in good condition, but when it starts to short you might hear static or lose a channel of audio. The plastic clips sometimes break and the wire shorts out after a while. Still, for the price, they're a good buy.

 review/summary: Magic!
 review/text: This oblect that I bought is so totally magic. It makes me phone able to use the FM radio feature by having a hidden antena in it. Not only that, but it can mysticly attach to the wire in my car and play music. A wizard had to have made this.

 review/summary: Worthless piece of equipment
 review/text: The company did not even send instructions for use...nothing. The only thing I recieved was the speaker adapter and antenna booster in a plastic baggie. I would send it back, but it would cost more in shipping than I paid for the adapter. I strongly discourage purchasing equipment from this company.
