 review/summary: Don't buy!
 review/text: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!

 review/summary: No instructions included...
 review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

 review/summary: Beware 3rd Party Cables & Sony Ericsson Tech Support
 review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

 review/summary: Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable
 review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

 review/summary: Gold Standard
 review/text: I've gone through many different bluetooth headphones. This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset. The BT820s, old school, just work. Period.

 review/text: According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices.

 review/text: The Motorola StarTAC Hands Free Car kit is outstanding. The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

Then place a couple of small (super tiny) drops of super glue on the EarGel and the Jawbone. Let it setup overnight and presto! You have a great bluetooth that stays in place. The other is to take one of the extra ear buds and take it apart and keep the ring. Place that ring inside the EarGel and glue it into place. Keep in mind you must have the correct position so when you put it on that it has the perfect fit once it is twisted.

 review/summary: Jabra gels fit well on my aliph jawbone after an accident

review/text: I accidentally tore the original factory bud off the aliph jawbone by not reading the instructions first, leaving a locking plastic ring which I saved. I bought the Jabra Clear Gels from 'Radio Snack' for under $5 and replaced the factory bud with this empty plastic ring on the jawbone, then pressed the gel piece over the ring and speaker hole to make a nice factory-like fit to the jawbone and a custom fit to my large ear canal. There was no extreme stretching of the Gel over the thin ring. The new Gel with the factory locking ring holds itself securely in my ear and the sound quality is much improved over the loose fitting factory buds.

review/summary: Fit is execellent.
 review/text: Used these to replace the painfuly uncomfortable original earpads on my Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and they're a tremendous improvement. Great that they include small, medium and large pads to ensure custom like fit. If not for these I wouldve had to chuck the earpiece in the garbage. They obviously won't fit every device out there so you maybe taking a gamble.

 review/text: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use.

 review/text: I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.

 review/summary: Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.
 review/text: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.

Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping.

 review/text: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. The set consists of 3 pairs of eargel (three sizes). Found the size that fit and inserted the ICON. Works OK, but not as snug as I would like on my right ear. Tried the left ear one and it was much better; fit was better and sound was louder. Tried several types of earphone adapters, and these seem to work better than most. If you have a problem with fit on one ear, try the other one.

 review/summary: Too Big
 review/text: Unfortunately, the ear gels in this set are all really too big for my ear. Not only that, but I can't figure out how to wear the "tab" that's on it. Does it go up, down, sideways, or at a slant to follow the "dip" my ear has just in front of the hole. And since I can't figure that out, & the fact even the small one is too big, it keeps slipping out of my ear. Thank goodness for the loop, or I'd have lost it long ago. Also, it becomes very irritating to the ridges in my ear & I usually have to take it off. I wish they still had the gels that came with the bluetooth. That one was really comfortable. This purchase turned out to be a lot more expensive than it should have been, since I now have 5 ear gels that I can't even use.

 review/summary: Great ear piece adapter
 review/text: The Jawbone bluetooth headset is a great little device, but unfortunately, none of the supplied ear pieces fit comfortable in my ear. I was all ready to return it, when I decided to try these Jabra EarGels. Well, I got them yesterday, and they make a world of difference. The Jawbone now comfortable fits in my ear, the little piece that is supposed to be touching my cheek is doing so. In fact, it is such a good fit I don't even need the other-the-ear hook any more!The EarGels come in three sizes, and are designed to fit the contours of your ear - not just to be shoved in an held in my force. Why JawBone themselves don't make something like this to come with the headset is beyond me, but at least Jabra stepped up to fill the void!

 review/summary: Best fit for jawbone era- so comfy!
 review/text: When I searched the net for a more comfortable ear piece for my jawbone era I came across this. I had read several mixed reviews about them. After a few more days of the era falling out my ear or my ear being super sore from the provided gels I took a chance.These are great. They are better than the jawbone ones in every way. They stay in my ear better. They are more comfortable. I can, also, hear the audio better.I give these five stars because they are perfect for me. If I were rating this for other folks I would probably rate it 4 stars because there are only 3 sizes. If you don't fit one it will be frustrating.

 review/summary: Completely Worthless
 review/text: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.

 review/summary: Makes Jawbone perfect
 review/text: I purchased this product after searching for ways to make Jawbone fit better. It worked!! Now my Jawbone fits perfectly, not popping/falling out of my ear. Also noticed I didn't need the volume as loud with audio directed into the ear canal. The Jawbone rests perfectly against my jaw for crystal clear conversations. It's also not necessary to keep the earpiece in the ear at all times while in standby. The eargels make the headset easy to find in your pocket/purse and put in the ear when receiving a call. I do recommend washing the earbuds with antibacterial soap and water prior to use then occasionally to reduce ear tenderness. Make sure to dry it well before putting it back on your bluetooth headset or other device.

 review/summary: Jabra Ear Gel and the Jawbone 2
 review/text: Ladies and Gentlemen..... I bought this product to go with my jawbone 2. and it is GREAT!! With this product I am able to take off the loop that comes with my jawbone and wear it all day without any problems. I actually have to turn the sound down when I wear it because it is loud. It looks so much better without the ear loop. I found the best way to figure out which size to use is to try the ear gels in your ear first until you find the right one. Be careful putting the ear gel over the Jawbone ear piece ( you dont want to tear it). There is a chance that these ear gels wont fit your ear but for the price they cost it is worth the gamble. If it fits you'll find a new level of comfort, sound quality and not to mention it looks a lot better to get rid of the ear loop.

 review/summary: The Aliph Jawbone 2 Savior
 review/text: These EarGels are the best solution bar-none to fix the comfort issue with the Aliph Jawbone 2. They make it possible to leave the jawbone in place for extreme durations. My only concern now is that my jawbone is so comfy and fixed it so well with no weight that I might fall asleep on it or take a sower with it on! To mod this onto the jawbone I simply removed the earbud O-ring and found the right size eargel for my ear. (Large in this case) then got some super glue to paint around where the O-ring attached on the jawbone, then simply placed the jawbone inside the eargel that I fitted on my ear. Left it in my ear for a few hours to dry and done. (Course I kept wearing it even after those hours were up) :)

 review/text: The eargels are functional, but they are a little awkward to put in. I've been using one with my bluetooth headset, and it certainly improves the sound. The term "gel" led me to believe they would be more comfortable than my bluetooth. However, like all headsets I've used, the gels irritate after ~30 minutes of use.

 review/summary: Excellent for use with The New Jawbone
 review/text: These eargels work with the Aliph The New Jawbone, or Jawbone 2, or the slim jawbone. I found that the earbuds provided from Aliph did not suit my ear. It was not secure even with the earloop attached. These did the trick. It was a gamble at first since i found barely any reviews on such a product with its compatibility with the New Jawbone, but it worked out for the best. These are not made for the jawbone so you are relying on its snug fit to stay in place. I removed the original eargel and replaced these onto the unit. It is snug enough for me to use without the earloop. Also its design makes the eargel stay in place in your ear. It may be tricky to fit in your ear at first but in time you'll get the feel for it. It fits my ear perfectly with the largest size. As a bonus you get multiple sizes. This is an excellent solution for those that don't have the right ear for the original gels provided for the New Jawbone.On another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel. Washing with water fixes it right up.This review is based upon purchase through Amazon and ownership for more than half a year.

 review/text: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.

 review/text: The title says it all. Preset sizes of the EarGels just don't fit my ears. The tube that directs sound does not go in my ear canal far enough and the hook that is supposed to hold the unit in your ear will not hold it in mine. None of the 3 sizes of gels made a difference.Try before you buy if possible.

 review/summary: The REAL Jabra earbuds
 review/text: "Jabra EarGels are designed to channel sound directly into the ear for perfect reception, so conversations sound clear and natural at both ends of the call. They are made of a translucent = BLUE =, soft material shaped to sit snugly in your ear for a comfortable and secure fit. Jabra EarGels are hygienic and washable and come six in a pack - three sizes for left and right ears."That is from the Jabra website. I just added something to the blue so it would stand out and put it in CAPS. That's probably why you guys are having problems, maybe they are fakes (the clear ones). Thought I would mention it. I haven't bought any but was looking into it. What bluetooth earpieces does it fit?

 review/summary: Use for iPod earbuds
 review/text: These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying.

A small piece of paper with a few pictures and labels would have helped out tremendously. If my impatient son or daughter would have bought them they would have returned them as unuseable.

 review/summary: It will be yellow after some months. It's just an eargel don't expect anymore
 review/text: If you are planning to buy it, I can guess you have bought an "extraordinary" Jawbone. I don't know if Jabra and Jawbone are a society but it is the only one option you have to get the handsfree in your ear.I think there are several ways you can use this gel to keep your headphones comfortable in your ear, however it has to be perfectly round and inch of diameter and no more than five milimeters of depth.If you are planning to buy them because you are planning to use it with a "wonderful" Jawbone, please consider other market options for BT handsfree.However if you have a very unconfortable and little headphones or an already bought Jawbone, it would be your unique solution. But maybe you won't ever need it if you look for a better BT handsfree device.

 review/summary: A good idea, but not a proper fix
 review/text: Kudos to the dude/dude-ette who figured out that the Jabra ear gels might improve the bad, painful and ineffective stock rubber covers provided with your Jawbone product. The Jabra gels aren't a perfect solution for my Icon-Hero, but they're heaps better than the original earbud-nonsense supplied with the bluetooth unit (which I totally dig). Still, the drama of finding a way to "rig" a $100 electronic device from a reputable manufacturer so that it doesn't hurt your ear is not cool. Aliph-Jawbone are you listening? I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit. Once you work that out, give it a chance as you and your ear may need a moment to adjust to how it feels. The volume improvement is nice too. Good luck.

 review/summary: Good solution for Jawbones that don't fit

review/text: If you have trouble getting your Jawbone to fit like I did, these may be a good solution for you. The largest one worked great for me. I wear it without the ear loop now. However, you can do a number of different combination with/without earloop and with/without the original ear buds attached to achieve your perfect fit. The other nice thing is that these sit in your ear and blocks out more outside noise so you can actually hear better. I found myself turning the volume down a bit after using these.

 review/summary: didn't quite work out
 review/text: As suggested by another reviewer, I purchased these ear gels to go along with my Jawbone, to assist in keeping the bluetooth headset in my ear and on my head. Unfortunately, contradictory to what the other reviewer indicated, the ear gels did not even come close to fitting over the ear piece on the Jawbone, and thus were pretty much useless to me. In fact, one of the gels even split open as I was trying to make it fit over the earpiece on the Jawbone. Maybe it's because I have smaller ear, and I had to use the smallest one, but it totally didn't work for me. Oh well, at least they weren't too expensive.

 review/summary: Very Comfortable
 review/text: I've used these ear gels on several products and have been very pleased with their comfort. I currently use them to on my Aliph Jawbone. They work well and there's no problem with hearing callers; however, if you think the Jawbone is difficult to get on with one hand you definitely don't want to add the ear gels and continue using the ear loop. Using the loop and gels in combination is a 2-handed endeavor and even then can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. I continue to use the loop because when I used the gel alone, I felt like the earpiece would not stay in securely in my ear. With the loop and the gel, the earpiece is snug and secure, even in the harshest (I drive a Jeep and take the top off) winds; and is comfortable to wear.

 review/text: I use these on the Aliph Jawbone so it's not surprise they're not perfect matches to each other. The eargels fit over the speaker nub on the Jawbone it's not exactly secure and I find the eargels fall off occasionally. I was also expecting these to act more like earplugs, that snugly fit in your ear canal but that isn't the case. However, the eagels do fit quite comfortably. I would imagine they're pretty good on the headset for which they were designed. They're nice and soft and molded to fit most ears, I would think (they fit mine pretty well). They're just little pieces of plastic so I'm not sure what else to say about them. If you're current headset is uncomfortable, I'd say go ahead and buy a set of these. They're not very expensive and you might find a good solution!

 review/text: I finally settled on my Jawbone Era after using many bluetooth headsets. It is the loudest, clearest, and best noise cancelling headset of all.The only problem is that the earbuds that come with it really such. They don't fit well and hurt my ear. Also, I don't like using the earloop to hold it in place.This is where the Jabra eargels come in. Install the Jabra eargel on top of the small or medium earbud of Jawbone, and you're set.I couldn't love my Jawbone Era any more. It fits better. It is louder to the extent I actually have to adjust the volume.

 review/summary: Better than standard earpiecs but not great
 review/text: I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says "what?" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this.

 review/text: I got them for my bluetooth, because I don't like them hanging on my ear and jiggling around. This works great when I can get them in right. No instructions on the proper way to where them, so I am guessing. Sometimes I get them in perfect and there great - other times they frustrate me. I guess after getting experience with them I'll be able to pop them in with no problem.

 review/summary: GREAT FIT AND MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT JAWBONE OFFERS !!!!
 review/text: I BOUGHT THE JAWBONE 2 SOON AS IT CAME OUT. THE JAWBONE 2 CAME OUT WITH SOME " NEW AND IMPROVED" EARBUDS, HOWEVER THEY ONLY WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THEN THE JAWBONE 2 WOULD NOT STAY IN MY EAR. THIS WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYING SINCE THE JAWBONE 2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE "TOP OF THE LINE".THEN I BEGAN TO SEARCH THE INTERNET AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE EARGELS. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THEY FIT GREAT INSIDE MY EAR; NO SLIPPING AND SLIDING, HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST THEM. I PUT THEM IN ONCE AND GO.HOWEVER AFTER WEARING THE SAME EARGEL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS ONCE I TAKE THE JAWBONE OUT OF MY EAR THE EARGEL WILL SLIP OFF. THIS HAS NOT BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM I JUST SLIP THE EARGEL BACK ON WHEN I GET READY TO PUT THE JAWBONE BACK IN MY EAR, AND IT STAYS PUT. THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH BUYING IF YOU HAVE THE JAWBONE 1 OR 2. THE DIFFERENCE IS NIGHT AND DAY. GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!

 review/text: I have a Samsung WEP200 which is a nifty little headset but felt awkward in my ear. These eargels improved both the fit and comfort of my headset. I love that they come in three sizes for each ear so there's something for everyone. My only beef: $8.87 is highway robbery for these things! I picked them up at a RadioShack store for about $2; you're better off doing the same.

 review/summary: Way too large!
 review/text: Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.

 review/text: These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.

 review/text: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.

 review/summary: JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES
 review/text: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone.

review/summary: Fast delivery, great product
 review/text: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.

 review/summary: Ears to you!
 review/text: Product arrived much quicker than expected. I have a Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece, and I keep breaking the ear-loop, and I could not find replacement parts. Not wanting to give up my Jawbone (and rather not buy a new one) I thought I would first give the Jabra EarGels a try... and I'm glad I did! My earpiece not only stays in place without the ear-loop, it just functions better. I CANNOT shake it off my head. It actually isolates the sound better into my ear. With 6 provided (3 left and 3 right) finding the perfect fit was easy (you will need to use the original ear cushion in addition to the EarGel for two of the EarGels to fit best with the earpiece) - all and all... a five-star product, and company!

Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.

 review/text: I have a motorola H695 bluetooth which I managed to adapt to use with the eargels, what a difference! I can hear better, I threw out the ear loop which I no longer need at all. The earpiece stays in very well. I use a large one with the bluetooth and I used the medium ones for my earphones which cuts out more of the background noise so I need less volume. The come with a set of three sizes sm med lg for both ears so you get 6 all together. Normally I have a problem with the earbud type earphones irritating my ear so I was suprised that the large eargel fits my ear the best.

 review/summary: So much better than "over the ear"
 review/text: I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.

 review/text: You can avoid the annoying over the ear adapter and switch to a partial in the ear gel that allows you to hear the message clearly in almost all reasonable situations without high volumes. It does a pretty good job staying in place, too. I have used the same adaptor for years with my old corded Jabra and car conversations have never been easier. If you don't mind having something in your ear this is great.

 review/summary: Don't waste your money
 review/text: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them.

 review/summary: Complete garbage
 review/text: I bought these Jabra Eargels from another retailer, because I thought they had the colored ones, which are supposedly more durable than their clear counterparts. Well, they did not have the colored ones, but the clear ones I received from them were horrible junk. I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through. I returned them, and who would blame me? See the title, this product is complete garbage.

 review/text: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments. If you work or play anywhere it is loud, you need these! I have since upgraded these to a custom earpiece, but if I hadn't gotten the Jabra's, I most likely would have chucked the Jawbone as unusable!

 review/summary: Not well suited for the Jawbone II
 review/text: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.

I guess I will have to look for something else.

 review/text: Didn't like the earloop that comes std with the BlueAnt bluetooth headset so I purchased a package of the eargels. My earpiece now comfortably fits in my ear and I can hear the call much better. It took a couple of tries to figure out which was the right size to use, so I was thankful for the variety. It takes a couple of days to get used to (feeling was slightly annoying at first) but the trade offs are totally worth it and my ear got used to it in no time.

 review/summary: They fit nicely in the ear, but don't work so well with jawbone
 review/text: I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.

 review/summary: Perfect for Jawbone 2
 review/text: Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssassin-Jawbone II (Black)[Retail Packaged]Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssasin-Jawbone II (Silver)[Retail Packaged]These ear buds fir snugly over the stem of the Jawbone II and fit snugly, comfortably in my ear. They were necessary for me to use the Jawbone as it requires both good ear fit and good jaw contact to work at all. Many, like me, cannot achieve both fits with the ear loops and buds that come with the Jawbone.In a perfect world there would be a Jabra gel half way in size between medium and large, but either works well for my ear. I suspect most ears would find a comfortable functional fit with at least one of the three sizes they sell (3 sizes, left and right per package). They only cost a few dollars.

 review/summary: Somewhat disappointed
 review/text: I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional.

 review/summary: The perfect thing to make the Jawbone Bluetooth headset fit - without the ear loop
 review/text: I was in hell with my Jawbone until I got these. I think I need to glue the thing on with a little Superglue, which I haven't. I keep it in a little pouch in my purse with my phone so it doesn't matter if it falls off...but gluing it on would fix it. But it makes my Jawbone fit perfectly and stay in my ear, and no earloop -- I've removed the dumb earloop altogether. You have to experiment with the sizes and play around with the fit at first, then it becomes second nature.Oh, and you have to remove the Jawbone earthingy -- the rubbery piece -- which is accomplished easily enough by turning it and pulling it off. It's on a little track, and turns like a jar lid.

 review/summary: Just OK but better than what Jawbone provides
 review/text: I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people.

 review/summary: Instructions on how to use with Jawbone
 review/text: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

 review/summary: Works great for Samsung WEP200

review/text: I purchased a Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset for my wife for Christmas. She liked it okay, but the OEM ear pieces did a poor job of holding the headset in her ear-it kept falling out, and she had difficulty hearing calls. I noted in Amazon's reviews for the item that some customers had bought Jabra EarGels to rectify the problem, so I took the suggestion to heart and purchased a set for her. As advertised, the EarGels resolved the issue: my wife now is very happy with the headset, and can hear calls just fine.

review/summary: Caution - Jabra Clear Ear Gels & Jawbone
 review/text: I recently purchased a Jawbone bluetooth headset. Works great. Ear fit was a little loose and I found myself pushing it more into my ear to hear better. Having seen the suggestions and other reviews to use the Jabra Clear Ear Gels, I decided to try some. Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet.

 review/text: On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.

 review/summary: I need two sizes!
 review/text: I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)

 review/summary: Everyone's ears are different
 review/text: With three different sizes and both left &amp; right options, almost everyone should be able to find a good fit within this package. Without a properly fitted earbud, the Jabra headsets just don't work well. I suggest you pick these up at this price, because they *do* tend to fall off every once in a while and disappear under the car seat. Having a spare on hand is a must.

 review/text: The problem that plagues the Jawbone is the fit. With these ear gels, the problem is gone and I don't need to use the ear hook. You will need to make sure that that the gel piece on the Jawbone touches your cheek and you will be good to go.I am using the Large sizes for my ears. Does anyone want to trade for the other sizes: small/medium? I figure that I'll never need those. Thanks.

 review/summary: Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets.

review/text: Excellent product. I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.

 review/text: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]

 review/text: I recently purchased a Aliph Jawbone BT headset. #1 BT Headset on the market IMHO. I wasn't wild about the piece that goes around your ear however. I never have been. So I picked up a pack of the Jabra EarGels. Best decision of my life. I pulled the plastic ring that snaps onto the Jawbone out of one of the earpieces that comes with it and stuck it inside the EarGel. Snapped it onto the Jawbone, and bingo. Instant comfort. Can't go wrong. Great product!

 review/summary: Very comfy and effective
 review/text: Bought these based on a recommendation from another site for a badly shaped earplug for a headphone I bought. The three sets (sizes) are really nice in that it allows some variety. The shape of these really funnel the sound into your ear, which is nice and helps with outside sound. The fit in the ear means that it will hold most headsets in your ear comfortably without a hook or other method from the headset.The nodule on the bottom fits over most earpiece sized rods - I've easily put it over one as big as a in-ear headphone jack and as small as the rod on my LG headset from work (which was far too small for every other one I found).

Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !

 review/summary: Ear Gels
 review/text: These work great and they fit more than just the Jabro products. They fit most standard ear buds. I use mine on my Bluetooth ear piece and the sound really does funnel into your ear canal, and it fits well enough that I no longer need the annoying over ear piece to hold it in place.

 review/summary: Jabra Eargels are better than the big round ear speaker
 review/text: the small is too small and the medium is almost too big - but those both fit in your ear and direct the sound so you can hear it good without it falling out of your ear. I used it on a samsung corded headphones that came with an instinct phone. the headphones round design is too big for normal ears and these helped. it's not a perfect fit is reason gave it 3 stars.it's priced right, but the $5 shipping is a rip-off. It could easily have shipped for under $2.

 review/summary: Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.

review/text: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.

 review/text: The ear plugs are comfotable, but are easily dislodged from the head set. The combination of the earplugs and headset are troublesome to put on. Many times the earplug becomes unattached in the process so one starts over.

 review/text: My boyfriend purchased these eargels based on other reviews on the Jawbone BT headset which indicated that these could assist with fit issues. I have not personally used the eargels, but my boyfriend loves them and is glad that he can wear his Jawbone comfortably and securely by using them. Amazon is a good place to buy these as we could not find them in traditional stores like Best Buy et al.

 review/summary: Decent alternative to the Jawbone "new fit" earbuds
 review/text: I love my Jawbone II but using the earloop was an issue with my glasses. I first tried out these Jabra EarGels and they worked decently. I especially felt like everything would fall out when I opened my mouth wide (yawning for example). Overall they were adequate and got the job done but now that Aliph is selling their own "new fit" ear gels I find I haven't been using the Jabras anymore. Aliph's fit my ear better.

 review/summary: Great for the jawbone
 review/text: For me, it fits well on my jawbone1. I just had to take off the jawbone ear hanger and ear piece, and put this rubber earpiece over it. When it's in my ear, I can jump up and down (not that there's a usual reason to) and it doesn't come off. I'm using the largest size for the right side. Just don't keep it in the car when it's hot outside, the rubber might get a little soft and come off the Jawbone. let it cool and it's back to normal.

 review/summary: Very functional, not very pretty
 review/text: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.

 review/summary: Jabra/Jawbone EarGels
 review/text: turned out good. took a little bit to get used to it but works fine no loop anymore required which is good considering I broke all the other ones I had. Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now..

 review/text: This is a must have for anyone that spends a lot of time in their vehicle. I had used all of the plug in ear accessories and they work well for short conversations and a short period of time. However, nothing compares to this. You place the phone in the cradle and thats it, it does the rest. While the phone is in the cradle, and the ignition is on, it is being charged. The phone can also be set to answer on its own when a call comes in and it will even mute the radio. I give this an excellent rating.

 review/summary: Excellent Product
 review/text: This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional "post" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!

 review/summary: Great product -- needs professional install unless very savy
 review/text: This is one product that you'll wonder how you survived without it. It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit. The only thing bad about it was that the Nokia 5165 phone was basically free for me but the hands-free unit cost alot more ...

review/summary: Safer Driving and Easier Communications
 review/text: I bought and installed the Nokia car kit (CARK-91) for my Nokia phone. Now, it is a real pleasure and quite safe to talk and drive. I often hold conference calls in my car on the way into the office. When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels. The cradle is strong and sturdy, and, with the phone attached, does not look out of place next to the steering wheel. Combined with Nokia's quick dial features, the car kit makes using a phone in the car relatively safe.

 review/summary: Simple, and a great value.
 review/text: Once again Nokia had their end user in mind when they designed a simple, useful and durable product in their mobile phone holder. I used it for over a year before I sold my car with the phone holder installed in it. I hope the new owner is using a Nokia phone, because I miss it. I have purchased a complete car kit and will install it in my new car this weekend, but in the meantime while I am fumbling with my phone in the car, (of course I'm using a headset), I realize how great the holder was. (...) There is nothing to think about except: where are you going to install it? Consistent with the sharp design and great support of their products, the low priced, functional mobile phone holder is another winner for Nokia.

 review/summary: An absolute must-own for Nokia users.
 review/text: Like most cell phone users, I had two chargers for my phone: The supplied wall-wart charging transformer, and the accessory mobile charging cord. The wall wart rarely got used- I'd have to find it, unroll the cord, reach down to plug it into the wall, etc. Not a very handy device. The mobile charger was much more convenient- if I remembered to use it, and if it was in the car I was driving. Oops, left the charger in the van. Oops, forgot to connect it. More than once I arrived at the office with a nearly dead phone.I bought this little stand on a whim, really, but it's turned out to be the single most useful accessory I ever purchased for a cell phone. Now, when I come home, I immediately drop the phone in the charging stand at my desk. When I leave the house, I grab the phone and it's always fully charged. I haven't used the mobile charging cord since buying this stand. I haven't had to.

I'd purchase this again however, as it's $3 instead of the $8 for the one with the light-up M.

The shipping and handling were more costly than the actual item. Anyway as one of the review said, it is not different from what is shown on the website and I assume it will also work without any problem ..

 review/summary: advertised as OEM??
 review/text: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.

 review/summary: Motorola car charger OEM?

review/text: The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)

review/summary: It's a car charger...
 review/text: It's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be OEM. All of the OEM chargers I've seen (model number SYN0847) has glowing stylized "M" motorola logo. This item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the "M" that glows when it's plugged in. All of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic Motorola. Maybe a really good knockoff? Anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.

Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to.

 review/summary: Typical Motorola quality
 review/text: Interesting shape and blue light that glows when this unit is plugged into the cigarette lighter. Can't believe that I've paid 5x as much for off brand car chargers in the past. Some have come apart, some have stopped working after shorting out. This Motorola charger feels like a quality piece and appears to be one that will last. Have no idea why anyone would buy an off brand when you can have legendary Motorola quality with a cool looking shape/light. Can't think of one thing that would improve this charger. The price is the best part!! Highly recommend!

 review/summary: Won't Recharge Anything
 review/text: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.

Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.

 review/summary: it charges..
 review/text: it's a charger - it charges your device - i dont even know what else to write - i actually use this one for my blackberry, not a moto device but since this has a regular mini-usb connector and accompanying voltage, it should work on any device that takes a mini-usb charger

 review/summary: Well made product at fair price
 review/text: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.

 review/summary: Motorola Razr V3 charger
 review/text: I ordered this charger for use with my wife's Motorola Razr V3 phone. I have had problems in the past with some chargers not working with this phone, perhaps due to the wiring within the USB connector. I received this charger within a couple days of ordering it, and it works perfect with the Razr.

review/text: It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source.

 review/text: This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for.

 review/text: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.

 review/summary: Phone great but......
 review/text: Love phone. Sleak design and not over burden with bells and whistles. However, Amazon and Cingular (AT&T) need to better coordinate the option of extending your Cingular contract with purchase of new phone from Amazon. Cingular over charged me $59.99 a month for an additional new plan....instead of extending my "family plan" contract for 24 months. Cingular customer service was terrible, Amazon on the otherhand was great. It took a day or two but they gave me a special Cingular number and my problem was solved. A great deal on a new phone but watch your phone bill closely.

 review/text: As someone else commented, the ear buds tend to fall out once in a while as they're a bit big. 4-stars only because I bought these for $9 inc. shipping but not worth buying if you have to pay upwards of $20. Buy an adapter instead and use iPod or Sony buds.PS: Haven't used them for making a call yet.

The cover fits like a glove and keeps my phone from sliding around and helps absorb the daily bumps my phone gets.The cover is well worth the money.The only problem is that the hole for the SD card door is not larger enough to allow you to open the door and take out the SD card without taking the cover off or you have to take a razor blade and enlarge the cell phone cover opening.

The skin isn't as thick as the OEM iSkin I use for my iPod. And like the black iSkin, you can easily see all the white lint and fuzz it attracts. But overall for the price, it's a good value. SHIPPING: Ordered Sunday night. BargainCell shipped it Thursday (they're based in southern California), received Friday.

 review/text: Fits ok. Stretches on easily (does not snap). No cut outs for any of the buttons on the middle of the phone (Palm Treo 755p) Can't see the power, green, five way, or the menu buttons. You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small. OK for now, but will keep looking for one that fits correctly.

 review/text: Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case.

 review/text: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain.

 review/summary: Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset in Orange
 review/text: Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked "bulk" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a "Motomanual." From all appearances it was brand new.

 review/summary: Good deal. Decent earpiece for the price. Has some minor issues.
 review/text: I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is "on" or "off". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not "sit" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did.

 review/summary: AARRRGH! It's... cool.
 review/text: This is a fabulous device. It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it.

 review/summary: Decent headset with comfortable fit, but tinny sound

review/text: Overall, my experience with this headset is positive. The sound is completely missing low frequencies, but you get used to that and voice clarity does not suffer.Fit is very comfortable, once you rotate the rubber stub to just the right angle (different angles for different ears). I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless.

review/summary: Small, Maybe Too Small
 review/text: This was my first attempt with a Bluetooth headset and I came away with the "just not right for me" impression. The AX2 is very small, but sound quality is generally good, with one exception. While I could hear callers just fine, it was next to impossible for me to hear the verbal commands from the phone. I also had a hard time operating the volume buttons. The only way to change volume was to take the headset from the ear. Overall, not a bad headset, just was not the one for me.

 review/summary: Highly Recommanded for People who wear glasses 6 STARS!
 review/text: For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

 review/summary: Best headset there is while it lasts...
 review/text: I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????

 review/summary: Great for the size, but average for the sound
 review/text: I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the "antenna" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality.

The AX2's funny looking earpiece is ajustable and can be cut to fit almost any ear. As far as the quality, are their better headsets out there... Yes, but are there better headsets out there for the money, I don't think so. I put a strong buy on this BT headset.

review/text: After having owned 3 different headsets I can safely say this has been the best for me. Sound quality is excellent and it is the only one I can effectively use in the car on the highway, others are just not loud enough. A tip I would offer is to not leave it in your car, the cold weather killed the battery and not I am left with a, very light, paper weight. Replacement batteries are $20.

review/summary: Worth about what you pay
 review/text: Pros:Pairing was easy. The thing does work, and is usable as an entry-level Bluetooth headset. Loved the mechanism by which it fits in your ear; that's very comfortable and secure at the same time.Cons:You pretty much get what you pay for. It looks nice, but it feels flimsy. When you plug the charger in, it feels like it doesn't fit, or you're putting it in wrong. That isn't a big problem, but it feels like a symptom of a cheaply made product.The performance of the AX2 I received was such that I thought it was defective and I sent it back for an exchange. It seemed like the connection between the headset and the phone was almost always plagued with bad static, the connection was dropped quite often, and people I spoke to while using the headset often complained that they could barely hear me.However, the replacement unit Amazon sent me (kudos to their return process and customer service, by the way) behaved exactly the same way, which tells me that this is just how this model is.In the end, I returned it and bought the just-released Plantronics Discovery 665, with AudioIQ (Amazon sells this, too, but I bought mine from Sprint). The difference is night and day. Of course, the Plantronics also costs several times as much, so it had darn well better perform.Overall, I'd say the AX2 is an okay deal if you buy it at Amazon's discounted price (do not go pay retail for this thing, it isn't nearly worth it and there are dozens of better models at the same price point), and you're only a casual user of the thing.

 review/summary: cool headset!
 review/text: I have had NO problems hearing or being heard with the Bluespoon. I love that it is so small and not very noticable. I also wear glasses quite a bit so I like that it doesn't go over the outside of the ear like a lot of them do. But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable. I'm so used to it now, I hardly notice it and it doesn't bother me at all. Everyone that sees mine wants one!

 review/summary: Inexpensive, outperforms most others
 review/text: This little dandy was quite a suprize in ease of use and performance.Pros:Very light. It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it.

 review/summary: Good product for the price you pay
 review/text: Let's start with the product's biggest advantage: for $37 (shipping & taxes), you've got a bona fide bluetooth headset. For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain.

 review/summary: Bluespoon, ehh works for me...I guess

review/text: Okay, this is the first and only bluetooth I bought/own - and I'm yes amazed at how small it is and how it's still able to be so clear. I use it for me ps3, not cell phone and it works great. The RED FLAG that I give on this piece, is that it hurts my ear - my ear gets sore after just a little while. I've cut the tail short, shorter and shorter, no help. Anyhow, I'm sure that's different for everyone as nobody has the same ear shape. All in all, besides a little red ear, I'm happy with it lol.-Govna-

 review/summary: I love it so much I've bought two.
 review/text: I paid [a dollar amount over twice what Amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if I put it here] for one at [a store the name of which Amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like I did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. Over the years I've tried headsets from AT&T;, Body Glove, Hello Direct, Jabra, and Plantronics, and I find the Bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, Jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and Plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on Earth).The soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). A good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. It weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it IN your ear, not just ON it.Once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. I don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). And once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. I have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.I had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the Bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. The headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. Once I got the phone replaced that problem went away. So if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. It might just be your phone.I bought a second one from Amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- I could turn the volume up, but not down. I've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now I have two that work. I've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.Pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; Bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.Minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.A minus only on paper: no noise reduction. In my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. I'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.

 review/summary: Great Earpiece - Still Some Issues
 review/text: This is my second Bluespoon AX2. The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did. Unfortunately the warranty is only 2 weeks - the shortest warranty period I have ever heard of.

 review/summary: Pretty good for the money.
 review/text: After two weeks of use, I'd have to say it's not that bad... Especially for the price! My Bluetooth 1.1 Sanyo Katana can't get more than 4 or 5 feet away but inside that and the clearity is great both in and out. Battery life is longer than my phone so that a plus. I really like the little tail thingy on the ear piece because it does a good job of securing the headset to my ear. I rarely have to turn the volume up all the way on the headset, and I don't have to speak loudly for the other end to hear me. The tiny size is awsome!The bad:The multi function button tends to shift and rattle a bit and every time I move my head and hear it, I think "cheap"The flashing blue LED is too bright in the car at night.Wind noise is a problem with this headset.I wouldn't steer anyone away from this headset who is looking for a low priced unit. Would I buy another one? It's possible. :)

 review/summary: Good idea, poor execution
 review/text: I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button "countersunk" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.

 review/summary: Very good product but not durable
 review/text: I was very happy with the bluespoon AX2 performance and ergonomics but was disappointed with its durability.The AX2 is incredibly small, light, and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable...

 review/text: AX2 is very unnoticeable and comfortable when you wear it. It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work. Overall, I like it and it works for me.

 review/summary: Who cares how cheap it is if IT DOESN'T WORK!!!
 review/text: After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

review/text: First of all the way it fits in your ear is very badly designed. The small rubber piece that looks like a tail is always poping out of your ear making the headset fall out.Sound quality and range are also inferior quality.

 review/text: This is the first and only bluetooth product that I have ever purchased....so I don't have anything to compare to. I would just say that for the money (19.95 + tax) that this product is well worth the money. I have great reception and everone can hear me very well and I can also hear anyone that I'm talking to very well.I have read many other reviews about this product and I don't have any of the problems that everyone else is having. The unit fits snug in my ear and it isn't loose at all. I have had to run yet while wearing it, but, I feel that if I had to that the unit would stay put. I haven't actually measured the distance that I can get from my Sony Eriksen Z525a phone but I feel that 20-30 feet is accurate and still maintain reception.My wife has a Motorola H500 bluetooth product that she uses with a Motorola phone. I feel that my Nextlink AX2 performs just as well and is about $30.00 cheaper in price.I would recommend the Nextlink AX2 highly.

 review/summary: Great headset
 review/text: I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.

 review/summary: "You Get What You Pay For"!
 review/text: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -"you get what you pay for"

 review/summary: too good to be true... almost
 review/text: this headset kicks! i dont even want to call it a 'headset', cuz it's waay too small for that.it's available online for about 20 US bucks, and it's worth 10 times that, easily.after using a Jabra BT200 with my newy aquired motorola L2, i wanted something smaller, so i found this little nugget. the Jabra worked quite well, mind you, but was a little too big of a gizmo than i wanted to sling up off the top side of my ear.the bluespoon AX2 is unbelieveable. it felt, literally, like it wasn't there. it communicated (bluetoothed) to my phone seamlessly. it communicated to me (thru some beeps and chirps) flawlessly.it took about three days of heavy use to get the 'set comfy in my ear, yet comfy or not it was always very secure and clear, both incoming and outgoing. it sicks in your via one of two (lg or sm)"soft springs" which are just soft rubber thingys that follow the inner contours of your ear.(this thing held on even when my own glasses fell off my head!) (thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public. (not everybody knows what a borg is..)so if you're looking for a cheap, light, comfortable, reliable, geeky, borg-like headset that's worth every penny, get a freakin sweet bluespoon ax2 beeootch!

 review/summary: still looking for my ideal headset
 review/text: Here's what I like about the headset:1. Extremely lightweight, with secure fit. It's easy to forget you have this on because it is so light. The soft spring easily fits into your ear and secures it. With the hook type headsets, there is some play during side-to-side head movement. This fits snugly in the ear and normal movements do not feel loose or unsecured. You do notice the speaker piece after it's been in your ear for more than a few hours, but it's not painful, just a little sore as there is only one size. I generally don't keep the headset in all day anyway, and only realized it because I had forgotten it was in.2. Incoming sound is very loud. It's in-ear design and fit allows you to hear very well. It's one headset I've used that I actually don't want at full volume.3. Has lots of ways to connect and conference calls. You can control switching from headset to handset from the headset, or connecting more than one call through the buttons.4. The blue talk light turns red when the battery is low, giving you a visual warning.Not so great:1. Lots of static in the bluetooth connection. I have my cellphone on my belt clipped on the left, and use the headset on the right ear. I do tend to notice this more when I am near a wifi source, but not always. I've also noticed it away from wifi signals (like my car). I've had the headset for about a week, and am still trying to figure out why a 3' distance on a 30' BT device would have so much problem with a clear connection.2. While the volume is loud, the sound quality is poor. My Motorola H500 wasn't nearly as loud, so I can't hear well when it's noisy, but the sound quality is much better. The AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies are boosted. While it may make voices easier to hear, it also sounds tinny and unnatural.3. Build quality is very mediocre. It's plastic, and I dropped it from waist level onto the parking lot surface. One of the volume buttons popped off, and the battery compartment was half popped out, as well as the plastic halves loosened. So now I don't have a volume button. I'd heard others say this unit breaks easily, and I can believe it might not have survived a drop from ear level.4. Headset tends to echo, although I don't know if it's worse than other BT sets. My Motorola echoed, but not quite as much as this. I don't notice it, but the person I call will mention it.5. The first day the power on/off tone was clearly audible. I don't know what happened, but after the first day the tone is muted so much I have to listen closely to hear the unit power on or off.I am still on the hunt for my ideal bluetooth set. Will try out the noise cancelling mics or bone conduction technology next because the older mic technology this represents leaves much to be desired.

 review/text: i had originally bought the motorola hs820. i was using it with a moto krzr. i don't know if my particular headset was faulty, but the sound quality was horrendous. everything sounded tinny and even synthesized. someone told me that bluetooth just doesn't sound right with a moto phone. i returned that and bought this headset anyway (it's so cheap and amazon returns are very simple, that i decided to give it another go). i was shocked when i saw how small it is (you don't realize just from the pictures). it's incredibly comfortable in my ear, and the sound quality is just as it is from the phone. no difference at all, and people on the other end don't notice i'm using a headset. i recommend buying this over any others. it's definitely worth it!

 review/summary: Great! ...for awhile
 review/text: When I first bought this headset in April 2006, it was amazing. It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it. I'm thinking about trying the new Samsung WEP200, as it's a similar small, in-ear design, which is one of the best features of this headset.

 review/summary: Not durable at all...move on to another headset
 review/text: I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another.

The piece that makes the headset stay on your ear is actually bends inside the ear and it was very painful.

 review/summary: No Complaints...

review/text: This BT headset is relatively small and unobtrusive compared to others I've seen. It is easy to use, the sound quality is acceptable and it fit my ear comfortably. After getting it, however, I realized that I really wasn't in love with the whole BT earpiece fad (people walking around, apparently talking to themselves, with a big plastic wart hanging out of their ear) - so I rarely use it. The only real complaint I can muster is that it is somewhat sensitive to wind noise and best used indoors or an enclosed area. If you have abnormal ears - it might not fit as well for you.

 review/summary: Great case
 review/text: This is the second Armour Case I have bought for a Palm PDA; prior to this I had used the Palm brand had cases. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Armour Case I purchase, not because of the case but because the Palm PDA's are no longer being made. Having said that, I would get it again in a minute if I had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the Palm-made hard cases I have used do. It has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning I can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the Palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). Having TWO Palm PDA's stolen in the last year (Note to thieves: these are NOT phones, guys!), I was lucky to still be able to get a Palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. But, I doubt I'll be able to get another Palm PDA if it happens again, which is unfortunate.

 review/text: I've used this case for over a year now. I carry my palm all the time in my jeans pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times.The catch that holds it closed works well, not hard to open (though with two hands). If I stick too many receipts in the back of the case the catch won't catch.Possible downside? The hinge opens along the long side like a book, so if you use it oriented that way the case kinda gets in the way. If you use it turned the other way (my preference) the case sits nicely in my hand for writing-awesome.Never used the belt clip, I've had terrible luck with those things no matter what they're attached to (phone, ipod, whatever..)

 review/summary: Way exceeded expectations.
 review/text: When I got my new Palm TX, I knew I wanted a hard metal case. I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one.

 review/summary: Better than the Palm case by a mile.
 review/text: One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.

 review/summary: Sturdy Protective Case
 review/text: I have had this case for about 7 months and I am satisfied with its performance. It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case.

 review/summary: Acceptable case
 review/text: I purchased this case based on the reviews here, and on my own prior bad experience with a Palm case. This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force.

 review/summary: Excellent Product
 review/text: This is my second metal TX case (the other one was a different brand). I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment.

 review/text: This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.

 review/summary: A few details were lacking, but the best I've seen far...

review/text: I purchased this after having a cracked screen on my TX, and paying a bundle for repairs. The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book. You cannot fold it back, behind the palm, out of the way.All in all I'm pretty happy, and haven't seen anything better. It looks like it will work well. I just see room for improvement.

 review/text: I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made.

 review/summary: Palm TX Armor case is okay but...
 review/text: The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments.

 review/summary: Great protective armor case, better than the original case.
 review/text: I think that it simply does what the manufacturer says it does, which is to protect the Palm, and in my case I've found that it is so. I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it.

 review/summary: Went through my snowblower.
 review/text: This story tops them all. I have dropped my Palm TX over and over with the Palm TX case. It's kind of banged up. The belt clip is kind of worn out. The springing thing won't hold it very well any more. The other day I got home from work and it was almost dark so I had to hurry and do some snowblowing. I heard a bump sound and didn't realize my Palm fell off the belt clip. I ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. I didn't realize it until I dug it out of the snow two days later. The TX was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. I snapped it closed and the TX still works fine! Just had to get a new stylus. Weird, because my first TX died on me with no bumping around and I got this replacement one under warranty.

 review/text: Bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. Other reviewers have had the same experience. The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again.

 review/text: The Palm fits into the cover securely and perfectly. The cover snaps closed a bit stiffly at first but after a week clicks shut easily and securely. Light slim solid case that takes a dropping well. Front cover has clearance so Palm's screen is not impacted at all. Two slots in front cover hold standard SD cards. Looks like there is enough clearance so cards will not press onto Palm's screen but I haven't tested that. Recessed access to top and bottom connection points on the Palm provide protection without ever having to take the Palm out of the case. It's very functional.

 review/summary: Worth It
 review/text: The case design is awesome, but steer clear of the metallic version. It scratches easily. Now I've got the black version and LOVE it. I like how the case protects my entire Palm TX. Not one corner of my TX extends beyond the case so if I ever drop it, it may be jostled, but not totally destroyed. The cut outs give you ample room to work with when turning it off or on and using cords, memory cards, or the stylus. There's even a little cut-out in the back for the speaker. The case latch is solid and doesn't pop open. Inside, there's a soft felt lining and slots for 2 memory cards. I don't use the belt clip, so this case is just fine for me and the price is right too.

 review/text: The aluminum case was disappointing. It looks like black plastic. Two of us struggled and struggled to get the Palm TX to fit in the case. After repeated attempts, we gave up and I e-mailed Boxwave. Finally after reading someone else's review, I realized that the funny piece in the middle of the case was supposed to slide into the TX. It worked fine after that. The box was labeled for the Palm Tungsten, not the TX. Simple instructions with the case, would've saved me a couple of hours of fiddling and e-mails. I agree with another reviewer who said the case is slippery also. I probably would not buy this again, but will keep it now that I have it.

 review/summary: Not good for the Palm TX
 review/text: I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such).

 review/summary: lose the belt clip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 review/text: I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip. It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat. This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well. It flops and swirls around. Otherwise, the case would be fine. I do not recommend.

 review/text: This is a very nice looking case. The PDA fits snugly and doesnt slide around. The latch on my case seems very secure and takes some effort to open. As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases. I dont rely on them.The main thing I dislike about this case is that it opens to the left, not the right like other cases Im used to. A minor thing that I can get used to.

I would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. Look elsewhere!!!

 review/summary: Could be better
 review/text: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.

 review/summary: Great Headset, Poor Fit
 review/text: This was my first bluetooth headset I purchased, and I made sure I researched it before I bought it. All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution. Great headset.

 review/text: This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer &quot;hands-free&quot;. It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise.

 review/summary: Decent, but a few problems
 review/text: The headset seems to pick up the user's speech fairly well. However, a steady &quot;clicking&quot; sound will sometimes arise which both the user and the person on the other end can hear. I tried to adjust the connection between the headset and the phone, but the noise persisted. It doesn't happen all the time, but does happen fairly often.Another feature that would have been nice but was not included is a button on the wire (as with wireless headsets for other phones) that allows the user to answer and hang up without having to deal with the phone itself.Overall, seems to be the best product available for the Nextel Iden series, but is not a great product.

 review/text: If you only need your clip to last about 3 months then this is for you. Maybe someone who works in an office could wear this clip but it is of no use on a job site. I think the design is poor, being that the working swivel parts are made of plastic, which over time will wear out. I'm searching for an alternative

 review/summary: Flawless
 review/text: Well I was skeptical as hell about buying from a company I've never heard of, for a product that was 1/5th the cost of what I felt was reasonable. I was completely wrong. In spite of being shipped USPS, it showed up the first day of the delivery window. I plugged it in and snapped on the cover (which actually seems marginally sturdier than the original), charged it... And didn't charge it again for a week. *FLAWLESS*. Dirt cheap bargain basement price, and my talk time went from 20 min (with a bluetooth headset) to over 3 hours... This is a massive amount of bang for the buck. No complaints and I'd make the same purchase in a heartbeat.

 review/summary: Extended life cell phone battery

review/text: The battery appears to be exactly what I expected. I purchased 2 batteries, one for my phone and one for my wife. After full charge the battery is good for up to 4 days or more in standby. The price was outstanding (about 25% of what Motorola wanted for the same battery with their name on it, plus the battery came with the required battery cover as the battery is a bit thicker than the original equipment). The only rub was that the shipping charges for the second battery was the same as for the first one even though they came together in the same package. Even with the excessive shipping charge it was still a bargain.

I've bought three of these, and will probably buy a fourth and fifth, simply because they are so cheap. They do need a way to charge these without being in the phone. All in all, a good deal for the money.

 review/text: This is a great extended life battery. Works great and the price is fantastic. The only thing you should know is that it is thicker than the normal battery and that is why it comes with a new back cover. It adds about a quater of inch to the thickness of the phone. For me this is a good trade off for the longer talk time and is not an issue at all.

 review/summary: Well worth the money
 review/text: I have a Motorola E815 phone approaching 4 years old and the original battery was only lasting about a day. I had heard that a new battery would cost me about the re-up price for a new phone from Verizon. Since my life is quite transitional now, I really didn't know what phone I wanted or needed, hence when I found this battery for less than $10 delivered I thought it was worth the shot. I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected. The battery and the new back still fits within my leather case, and it gives probably four days with moderate use. More usage cuts it down, but I still get a couple of days before it needs to be recharged.

 review/text: Stop fooling around with clipped conversations and embarrassing lost calls. Its so nice not to worry if you have enough juice to finish the call, or sweat the fact that you forgot to charge the phone last night. With this battery it'll wait till tomorrow. Just checked mine after two days off the charger. The phone still shows a fully charged battery. I have never had this battery go dead in use.My only concern was if the larger size would require a larger phone holder. It adds only a 1/8 inch in thickness, if that. The back fits just as well as the OEM, same color and everything. This is an easy decision.

 review/summary: Great way to put off getting a new phone

review/text: Let's face it, unless you want to go iPhone, there's not much exciting about the current cell phone market. I've had my Moto v710 since September 2004. The only problem I was having was battery life. I bought 2 of these replacement batteries because of the price. I figured just in case one is a dud I'll have a second and still it wouldn't be a bad deal. The battery is awesome - longer life than the original battery when it was new. I got it back in May and it's still working great - haven't noticed much decline in its lifespan either. And if it does ever start to lose charge, I still have an unopened one. Do yourself a favor and get 2... you'll be set until a worthwhile phone comes along that is worth the upgrade.

 review/summary: Great Battery
 review/text: Seemed a little light for a battery twice the size of the original but the original never lasted this long. After the first charge it lasted nearly a week. Don't have the ability to test if it's actually 1400 mAh or not, but like I said, it lasts a lot longer than the OEM battery did new. Great deal and comes with a new back cover, I'm quite satisfied, thanks.

 review/summary: Small Phone with Big Features and Big Performance
 review/text: First this is a beautiful phone with a beautiful size and a beautiful feature-set targeted for a busy biz type. Features are tri-band for reception, Dictaphone for voice memos, Speakerphone for hands free, and PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar for todo and event alarms with day/wk/mo/yr repeatability on recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take out the trash :), etc.ALL the features work great. Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, and speakerphone, all adjustable. Has a separate power switch on top for quick access to ringer options(one press) or power-off(press and hold)for batt save, etc.It is so small you can wear it in the watch pocket of jeans, in a shirt pocket, or your pants pocket without a bulge. Still, the keypad layout is such that I find it easy to dial because the keys cover the total keyboard, unlike my previous SE T234 small point buttons. For those who derated this phone for its small size, I don't get it? If you want a bigger phone that has bigger keys and a bigger screen, get one for heaven sake. Please rate a phone for its features and performance, not its size. That is a positive for those who want this.Those looking for a well featured small phone with Nokia's quality and RF reception, you will not be disappointed with this one. You will not get a camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, or memory enough for gobs of games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers and video(this is the Nokia 6230i). You will get an excellent and practical communication and organizational device having enough memory for adequate games/ audio/video accessories and the features required for the practical user, and a good price.Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud but adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator and flashing keyboard silent modes, small and VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync with Nokia's free down-loadable SW. Standard barrel-type charger plug.Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, no side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys.

 review/summary: Cool Phone For A Cool Price
 review/text: I've always owned a Nokia phone simply because it works for me(and I'm a creature of habit). =) If you could care less about owning a tricked out, camera flip-phone with all the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you. The one thing that really differs with this phone (compared to the three other Nokias I've had over the years) is that these buttons are really small and it can literally be a pain sometimes when you're sending text messages. After owning this phone for nearly a month now, here's what I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has a useful voice recorder* Speakerphone is very useful (esp. if you're driving and don't own a headset)* You can change your right, navigation button to create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly for those that are cell phone challenged* Comes with a sleek travel size charger* If you're a Cingular customer, this got better reviews compared to the fancy-shmancy (and more expensive) Samsung, LG and Ericcson phones they also offer.Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume has a big difference between levels 2 and 3* If you own a headset for older Nokia phones you have (such as a 3595), it won't work with this one. You'll have to splurge and buy a new headset. =(* Ring tones are kind of weak, I'm 30 and it feels like they had teens in mind when creating ringtones for this phone (same thing with the wallpaper options).* Games are cool, but the bowling game is only limited to +/- 5 games before you're denied access.Hope this was useful for anyone interesed in buying this phone. =)

 review/summary: Great phone, but pretty basic
 review/text: I recently subscribed to a two year Cingular service. At first I purchased a Motorola V551, but that gave me poor reception compared with my Samsung E315, which I previously owned. Not wanting an expensive phone that would drop calls frequently, I decided to trade it in for a Nokia, becasue my father used Nokia ever since he started to use cellular services, and he was extremely satisfied. The Nokia 3120 appealed to me because of it's styling. Although it is not as technologically advanced as the phones I was used to, the styling appealied to me, along with the fact that the phone was 39.99. I truly like the styling. It is the best I've seen in the bar phone class. It is not outlandish in any essence. It is a smart phone for people who want basic functionality. What also appeals to me is the user interface. It is the best one I've seen for any phone. It is the smae interface used on all digital nokias, which date back to about 1996, which is when I first was exposed to Nokias. It is extremely simple to use, the most convinient features can be accessed with two or three button pushes. The biggest thing that got me to purchase this phone is it's reception. Better than any phone i've used. I can use it deep inside buildings. My mother has a Nokia 6010, and she can call from the breakroom in her office, which is in the center of the building. All this packed in a sleek, understated enclosure makes this phone very pleaseing.My only complaints about this phone is the lack of "fun" features, such as a camera or video playback. If you really want a camera phone, but like what you hear abou this Nokia, the 6230 is for you, and I will buy that in 6-12 months. Another thing I do not like is the color. You can get covers for it, but the middle part of the phone, where all the circuitry and the antenna lie, is pasty white, which for a guy like me, is girly. One of my friends commented exactly. One flaw, though it does not bother me, is the size of the phone. While it is higly portable and compact, the buttons could be too small for some.A summary of pros and cons (some i did not list above)ProsStyling and portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize of keypadlack of "fun" features such as camera, although it has a camera attackmentI know this review is very long, but I wanted to cover all aspects of the phone so as not appear bisaed in any direction. I do like the more expensive phones, but that doesn't mean I can't make a logical critique of any phone.

 review/text: A couple months ago, I had a Nokia 3120;however, I wanted to try something new. So I purchased a Motorola v551. At first I was happy I did so, but later I regreted it. So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola. I absolutely love my Nokia 3120. It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great design. I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception. It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.

 review/summary: Decent entry level non-flip phone
 review/text: I've had mine for over a year now, so I thought I'd offer some comments.First, buy a case. This is not a particularly tough phone. My teenage son killed his within six months. Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it. I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone. If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty. I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right. Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness "down." When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling. I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones. Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone. I've looked at others but, for now, have stayed with my little Nokia.

So far, i am very pleased with this phone and it never drops my calls, and my signal is always on full strength. It has good battery life, that lasts up to few days, the interface is intuitive because Nokia's are known for making cellphones simple, and at a great price. Also, the phone came the day before the estimated arrival date. If your'e looking for a good site to buy a good phone, then your'e in the right place(Amazon). ;)

 review/summary: static in reception and speaker interference

review/text: I have been a longtime Nokia supporter, and love that they sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones that pick up great reception. However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker, the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises. This included my car stereo and my speakerphone at work.

review/summary: Tiny phone for tiny hands (i.e. men need not apply)
 review/text: I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC

 review/summary: all of your basic necessities, plus a bit more
 review/text: At first glance I fell in love with the phone - the small design, the chrome plated front, all my friends just love it, thinking its another high-priced, fancy phone from nokia/cingular, when surprisingly it was very affordable, but I must admit - it IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly.It has everything you want and need plus more. It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.

Its somewhat stylish i guess ive seen a couple people with it is a very good basic call phone and texting. other features include internet which is expensive and kinda worthless. The only thing i can complain about is about 9 onths in i was at my computer doing some school work i placed it near the speaker and a friend called it made a reall loud staticy noise (my speakers were up pretty loud so that could of contributed to it)it was actually starteling and made me jump up and turn off the computer. about a weak later i put it on my tv entering my room layed down and another friend called and it did it again not as loud but still pretty annoying. Anyway its not like the world will end but you might get startled once in awhile.

review/text: I needed the charging cord, so this seemed like a a great deal. The case fits fine and the handsfree was a ok, about the same as what came with my phone in the box. It's nice to have a spare, my kids will probably loose mine before long.

review/summary: Very good as 'Phone' (Cheap & works fine)
 review/text: I got new apple 3g .. That was my biggest disappointment. So Returned it and got this phone. This is pretty cheap and almost for free. This phone doesn't have hi-tech functionality like you-tube, bluetooth etc. Internet browsing i didn't try but who cares... you have to keep in mind that this phone is just for basic purpose.Signal quality is excellent. I get bars even every one are having 'no signals', very light weight and very good battery life. What else you are expecting as a 'phone'drawbacks : no bluetooth but getting handsfree wire device is also getting rare because of marketing techniques. Also I miss volume control buttons on side.but overall I am very happy and dropped all plans to buy any other phone

 review/summary: Great phone - unless you are outside or in the car
 review/text: I only needed a basic phone - no MP3, camera, or FM radio. This phone delivered with great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, and a very small size. Inside a building it works great. Why the low score? The tinted plastic over the display makes it impossible to see the display outdoors and in the car. If the sun is out, forget it! I even managed to figure out how to remove all of the wallpaper backgrounds and to maximize the contrast. Still, don't plan to use this outdoors. Nokia should recall this product to replace the tinted cover. Update: Yesterday this phone took was accidently dropped onto a very hard ceramic tile floor and it still works perfectly! A similar drop ended the life of my digital camera a few months ago. So, if I were to rate this cell phone now I would give it 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars. I like reliable, sturdy stuff and this cell seems to be unusually well made.

 review/summary: fairly durable phone
 review/text: I was looking for a durable phone that could take a blow or pressure and keep working. I also did not want random pieces of it falling off when it was struck. I'm a fairly small individual and I also needed a phone that had to be small enough to fit into my pocket comfortably with no protrusions to gouge me. I did not need a camera or any extraneous features like that. This phone seems to be fitting these criteria perfectly. I was planning on spending quite a bit on a phone to meet those criteria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone was free on my plan.I have dropped it a couple of times from about 10-12 feet up onto concrete and it keeps working just fine. It has slid for about 20 feet across a piece of concrete. It does have some minor scuffs after this but nothing significant. It does not have any buttons on the sides so there is nothing there to have fallen off when it hit the concrete. It has been submersed in a water tank and seems to have come back from it well also.As far as visibility of the display issues that other people have mentioned in their reviews, I have noticed that it has what seems to be a "power save" type situation it kicks into where the display is difficult to read. Hitting certain keys seems to kick this "mode" off. Other than those situations I have had no more difficulty reading the display than on other candy bar style phones I have had from Nokia. I have used it in direct sunlight and in various other lighting situations.

 review/summary: A welcome return to simplicity by Nokia
 review/text: Here's how I rate this cellphone:1. Voice quality and reception: +12. Battery life: +13. Fast opening and browsing of menu and sub-menus: 04. Build and keypad spacing: +15. No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5.The other reviewers are right about the screen in sunlight: it sucks. But if you're like me and are chained in a cube for the daylight hours, it doesen't matter that much.The only thing I dislike about this handset, is that it is quite slow in opening its submenus. I would have thought that such a basic, stripped phone would be lightning fast; indeed, it was one of the reasons I bought it, but not so. Gone are the days you could unlock your phone and call a contact within a second.Besides this con, it is solidly built, has exceptional voice quality, and is easy to dial with if you have thick fingers.

 review/summary: No wonder they pay you $150 to take it...read on
 review/text: NOT even an 'entry level' phone as they would have useful basic functions. Entry level should have a screen you can see in the light and a reliable ringer. Display has no brightness adjust only contrast which is useful for making the screen harder to see not improve. Using any wallpaper but white makes the screen impossible to see/read text even indoors in all but a dark room. Fonts have a setting to enlarge (Nokia knew the screen was junk) text but the small display prevents this. Calls have barely audible sound quality to understand the conversation (not due to signal). Buttons are too small for hands larger than medium-sized fingers and don't always make contact first time. Screen back-light doesn't always light when first button is pressed. When backlight is off screensaver time display is impossible to read when activated. Battery time is good most likely due to screen being dimly lit. User settings are all over the place in a unintuitive fashion making personal settings a time consuming chore instead of one menu.I can do w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc. but to fail in the basic functions of a cell phone is pretty bad & not acceptable. No wonder they PAY you $150.00 to take the phone.NO STARS

 review/text: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.

 review/summary: Durable basic phone for those who like to squint
 review/text: This Nokia is about as simple and basic a telephone gets nowadays.You get good sound quality and easy texting in a compact unit.The major drawback is very poor highlighting of menu icon selections.If you have activated many features, this cell will frustrate you.It's a crapshoot what you actually select. I had to buy 2X magnifying specs in order to utilize menu features.Also, the signal strength and battery power indicators can be very difficult to see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) and rapid battery charge rate.The vibration indication for incoming calls is very effective, and ringtones can be adjusted easily.In regards to pricing, AT&T; sometimes will give this cell free for activating two years service. The highest price AT&T; ever charged for this Nokia is $9.99, in refurb condition.I've had my Nokia for half a year, and I appreciate it; it's not perfect, but it is useful. A phone should be a phone, not a portable entertainment system. Thanks to the magnifier specs, I don't have to squint at the screen anymore.

They send it to you for 'free" - lock you into a 2yr contract and then charge you 10x the actual cost of the phone for ETF.

review/summary: Excellent basic level phone
 review/text: As a seventeen year old female, I do tend to use the phone a lot. I got this phone without texting, and I still love it. I have no idea what the other users are talking about with the backlight, mine is always perfectly viewable. Maybe they just need a teenager to work it. ;PThe only problem I have with the phone is that I have a nickel allergy, and the metallic looking finish on the menu and surrounding buttons caused my face to break out with a rash, but as long as I use the easy-to-use speakerphone button, or get a good cover or headset, I should be fine.This phone was easy for even my 60 year old father and computer inept mother to figure out, with minimal help from me. I wish the record function wasn't so scratchy so I could record songs for ringtones, but what do you expect when most people can afford texting and ringtones.I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but as I can't a full five stars for this product!

 review/summary: Slow to ship
 review/text: I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again.

review/text: Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.

Otherwise I like it so far.

 review/text: i got this phone about 3 months ago with cingular. i got one of those "go phones". my previous phone was a tmobile nokia 3595, i decided to go to cingular because tmobile did not have any service at my school. so far im happy with the phone but not cingular, my phone is out of minutes within 2 weeks when it should be 4, on my old phone it was 10 cents per txt message & im, and it was free to recive, cingular is 5 cents to send 5 cents to recive, at first i thought that was ok until i signed onto aim on my phone, i went on my computer and talked to my friends i felt my phone vibrate and it alerted me that i had used 5 cents, these messages kept coming for every message that i had sent on the computer, with my tmobile phone it would foward the ims to my cell but it would not charge me cause i did not use my phone i used my computer. also i had went upstate and i was roaming, since i had a prepaid plan i couldnt make or recive calls, with my tmobile i never roamedPros: downloadable games graphics and ringtones, can do everything a plan can do (prepaid plans), good service,Cons: Expensive, charges you a cent per gigabyte on internet, cant make calls when roaming (prepaid)

 review/summary: Sure to break at some point
 review/text: I purchased two of these phones at a discounted price when I signed up for a Cingular plan. Both phones are already broken and I have only had them for 6 months. My wife's phone had the corner of the phone crack and then break off making it hard to open the face without having the screen slip out of the hing. My phones screen just got a great big blob of color in the middle so I can't read anything on the screen. The phone was great while they worked, light weight, easy to use, good ring and opptions... I'm just not happy that it lasted only 6 months. If you do buy this phone be sure to get insurance since it will probably break at some point.

 review/summary: Small and elegant, but with a few issues
 review/text: This is a simple to use, small, light and generally elegant flip phone, with good reception.Some useful comments for those interested in getting it:-It looks nice and has a fast and responsive user interface (I found the LG interface much better than the Samsung x426). It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.

 review/summary: One person's pro might be another's con
 review/text: Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon. That night, it stopped working. I won't miss it.

 review/summary: First cellphone and IT ROCKS!!!

review/text: The LG C1300 is a sleek, small and very nice cell phone!! Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few "cool" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror. If you are considering in buying a cheap yet great quality design, BUY THIS!!! Oh by the way, Cingular ROCKS!!!!

review/summary: LG C1300 free is still a ripoff
 review/text: First, I hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than "when are you getting home?" "seven." "okay, see you then." because you will spend half your time saying, "wait, can you say that again?" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better. If you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. At least you can keep photos in it.

 review/text: Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better("red") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the "free" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call "Warranty Service" to get the new "red" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is..

 review/summary: Too many BUGS!
 review/text: I only owned the phone for about two weeks and it was already acting up. First, the hinges became kind of squeaky and just felt horrible to hold the phone. Then, the battery wouldn't even charge. I plugged it into the charger and it looked like it was charging but when I pulled it out, it was still at one bar. And it went down to one bar overnight.. after I had charged it until it was supposedly full. It appears that other people had this problem as I saw people returning the same phone because of these issues.So I highly don't recommend it.

 review/text: I have owned this phone about a month and I've had to take it back to the store 2 times already. The first time the phone "pretended" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking. The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that's about the only thing redeemable about the phone.

 review/summary: THE WORST EVER
 review/text: This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!

 review/summary: Horrible Phone
 review/text: I am actually on my second phone because the other just stopped working. Sometimes it would not allow me to touch certain keys, so I sent it back to Cingular. I thought the problem would be resolved after I got a new phone, but I was wrong. Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work. This Phone is a curse do not get it. My coworker has this phone and she has the same problems. I can't believe I paid $129. on this dam phone.

 review/summary: Don't Buy It!! Warning!! Worst Phone Ever Owned!

review/text: I renewed my 2 year wireless contract for the 2nd time last week and had decided to upgrade my phone. I've had 2 previous Nokia phones free with my plan. I really liked Nokia's performance, but my phone provider does not offer any with a flip phone style. Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience. I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia. I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone. I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well. This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly. Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk. BUYER BE WARE! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!

Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!

Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying. I feel like crushing this phone sometimes. I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls.

 review/summary: Worthless
 review/text: This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.

 review/summary: Not worth it....
 review/text: -I've had this phone for about one year. I've hated it since week one.-It's a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the "upgrade" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don't care about thier customers.

 review/text: This phone is horrible. I live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. People sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. The mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. I think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. DONT BUY IT. Its a waste of money. Find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( I wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. I would give it a -5.

 review/summary: DON'T BUY IT!!!

review/text: This is the worst phone I have ever had. The speaker is terrible. You have to shove it into your ear to hear anything, even after you have turned the volume all the way up. After having it for 3 MONTHS, the screen went blank and I couldn't see anything. Luckily, Cingular sent me a new one. However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery. The buttons on the side are a pain because they will get pushed inside your pocket and make the phone beep and go out of silent mode. Very annoying. So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT!!!

review/summary: Not So Bad After All
 review/text: I got this phone over three years ago. It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, "What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)

 review/text: My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it.

I have dropped it onto concrete before and there were no scratches and it still worked fine. I never found any bugs or errors. Service is excellent and I have yet to have any problems with it.However, as others have stated you can't choose shortcuts- they are chosen for you. IM & text messaging are 2 of the chosen ones. Never the less, its still my favorite phone

The C1300 has internet acess, tons of ringtones, and great color display, along with many other features such as a calender, and note pad. This phone will replace a handheld. This phone is also a very ruged phone. i droped this phone in the pool on accident for 10 minutes and it still works. I give this phone a 9.8/10.

 review/text: This is a great Phone! ITs my 3rd phone and i have had problems with 2 of the three. the first one was ugly, and the second one, the battery life was no good. But when i got this LG C1300, it rocked my world! The Battery Life is awesome and the features are real good. You can download ringtones without going online which is really cool and easy. It has a well lit screen and the volume of the ringtones are really loud. The hearing part is awesome, i put it on a volume 3, because when it was on a 5 its like a speaker phone. It only includes one game which is very similar to snake. The picture does not look the same, the big thing in the middle is really a mirror like thing and it flashes green, it does not stay solid. Overall it is a really good phone and i reccommend everyone to go and buy it!

 review/summary: Pretty decent little phone
 review/text: For years, I have resisted the whole cellphone, constantly connected to the world thing. Then, this Christmas, my folks decided to put me on their Cingular family plan and finally force a cellphone on me. At the cellphone store, all I cared about was finding something small, simple, and unobtrusive. This phone seemed like it would fill those requirements perfectly. Well, it has. Both call quality and battery life have seemed more than adequate. I live on the edge of civilization in northwest Colorado where cell towers are few and far between, but I have had what is (to me) suprising success in getting a good signal where one would expect one to be. It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up. If you need a good reliable form of communication and also don't need it to be the center of your life, this model fits the bill.

 review/summary: This phone SUCKS!! Dropped calls left and right
 review/text: My wife got this phone to replace her Samsung X427m that was stolen. I suggested she stick with the Samsung but she wanted something different. She got this phone off of Ebay for $50.Even at $50 this phone is not worth the money. The phone's problem is that the reception absolutely sucks! I am lucky to get 2 bars in my own house using this phone!! Whenever she calls me on my cell or landline phone, the call drops after 5 minutes or so. Its not my cell phone because my SE T637 always has at least 4 bars where ever I go. As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with her and the call dropped for the 3rd time in 10 minutes. I have been trying to call her back, but the call won't go through.This phone reminds me of the nightmares of MetroPCS' pitiful coverage. But the problem here is not Cingular service, its the phone! I can't believe Cingular would allow their name to be branded on this piece of garbage.LG sucks! I will never purchase another LG phone again.I will be getting my wife the Samsung X427m which we had no problems with and NO dropped calls!the only good thing about this phone is the bright screen, but what good is that if the phone doesnt work worth a crap to begin with??NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!

 review/summary: It's below average, but not terrible.
 review/text: It's your basic phone.It calls, it receives, and keeps a phonebook.It has one game, and the basics of calculator, memo, calendar.The graphics/wallpaper isn't that great, but it's just a cheap phone anyway.It has some cheesy ringtones, rather ridiculous actually seeing as how my friends are always laughing whenever they hear my ringtone.It has a vibrate feature, but you can only use the vibrate feature for two levels: when silent & on vibrate, or when on loudest & on vibrate. Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to "flip" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end. In turn, you must scream into the mouthpiece to have the other party hear you. And if you're wondering, it's not the service quality. I tested it with my old Nokia 3595, where I can hear perfectly fine and whisper and have the other party hear me.The battery life has been okay for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've had this phone. Sometimes the battery lasts a long time, but other times, the battery drains for no apparent reason.Regarding signal, I receive about 1/2 the signal on the LG than what I receive on my old Nokia 3595.

I love how small it is and how I can stuff it in a pocket or purse, or even just carry it around in my hand. The ring tones selection is good and the vibration is good as well. Most cell phones I can never use on vibrate, because I simply do not notice when the phone rings. This little sucker will let you know. Not a perfect cell phone, but no where close to being the worst I have ever owned over the last 11 years!

 review/summary: Horrible Reception
 review/text: This phone is the worst and most expensive phone I have ever owned (I got it before it was free). It has horrible reception and it drops calls left and right especially in areas of higher density. The clarity of almost all my calls is incredibly bad. It scrathes very easily. Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones. It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages. Voicemail doesn't work half the time. There's no voice recorder or loud speaker. You can't see the screen in the sunlight. Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying. There's no snooze on the alarm. The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone. The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time). I'm a college student and my phone is my main source of calls and I have to charge this phone almost every day and I have to take the phone charger with me even if I'm gone just for the weekend. I'm very unhappy with this phone. I wouldn't even get an LG again.

 review/text: This phone is not worth the money they charge for it. The voice message never worked right. The volume buttons were on the side of the phone so I was always turning it down to where I couldn't here it on accident. But the worst part is having a contract with cingular. I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual. This phone and cingular are not worth the trouble and expense.

These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back. They have a horrible reputation.

 review/summary: A Great Little Phone
 review/text: I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim. I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance. So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one. I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton . I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i. I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would. I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem. A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package. I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market. Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot.

 review/summary: Excellent Product, Performs Exactly as Advertised!
 review/text: The Andrew Extensis is a great product! Remove the Baby Bell service from your home or business, then plug this unit into a phone jack with the cellphone in the cradle. From any phone in your home or business, including cordless phones, you can operate exactly like you always have. The benefit?? You now have all of the features, and plan advantages of your cellular phone. It is great for a small business as the owner can take the phone when they leave, or leave it in place and allow the calls to go to voice mail.There is one potential fault. To place the Nokia phone in the cradle, one sets it into the cradle with the phone vertical. After it latches, it gently leans toward the rear of the unit. I accidently broke one I had because to remove the Nokia phone without damage, you must tilt the phone to the front of the cradle before removal.My only other concern with this device...... I wish Andrew had units available for phones other than the Nokia 5100/6100 and Startac. Once these phones are no longer available, what will we do? I can hope!

 review/text: The Andrew Extensis has been a great addition to my home. I run all the phones in my house through the Extensis and have saved $20/month (relative to having both cell and landline service) through using this device. It's reliable and allows me to have extension phones throughout the house rather than carrying a cellphone from room to room. Given the fact that increasing numbers of folks are using cellphones as their principal telephone (see New York Times of August 2003) it's surprising that this item has been discontinued and nobody else seems to have picked up on the concept.

 review/summary: well worth it
 review/text: I use a 2 line cordless phone throughout the house. Line 2 is the cell phone, courtesy of the extensis. Now, I can use my cell phone (via the extensis) throughout the house without losing a call due to poor cellphone reception.The only problem I have is that when I upgrade the phone, I can not get another extensis (since Andrew Corporation has stopped manufacturing these devices).

 review/summary: Great phone...great price.
 review/text: I have not had one single problem with this phone. I can hear people clearly when I make outbound calls and recieve inbound calls. Loaded with features. Reliable phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have had nothing but problems with them. (Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options.

 review/summary: Very good phone with very good service
 review/text: I like the heft and feel of this phone and it comes with every feature I can envision needing other than a speakerphone. The buttons are large enough to avoid accidental presses of adjacent keys. There are three, count 'em, three buttons to take pictures. That is probably overkill. This is my first LG phone and I selected it based on the feature set but also because I've been told and read on the web that the phone handles weak signals well. So far that is true.After a horrible experience with the Motorola 720 which dropped calls faster than fall leaves and an experience with Verizon's highly praised customer service that I wouldn't wish on an enemy, (Let's just say it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Worse than the old Compaq Computer. Worse than Packard Bell (remember them). Worst ever!) I am pleased that so far the L1200 with Cingular service works better in every part of my home and city than the 720 with Verizon.I know service varies from place to place and I am certain there are locations where Verizon is better than Cingular, but here and now I am once again experiencing what I expect from a mobile carrier- a good product and good coverage.

 review/summary: Great phone, not-so-great ringtones
 review/text: Upgraded from the Nokia 3650 because I wanted a camera phone. Picture quality is decent enough considering it's a phone. Reception is great, all the time. I've had this phone for two months and have dropped only one call, early on. The interface is very easy to understand.My only complaint is in regards to the ringtones. The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs. What's worse, you can't record your own and use them, as with many other phones. You have to go to Cingular's site and shell out $2.50 apiece for twenty-second (or less) audio clips.

 review/summary: Even better than I thought

review/text: Everyone in my family has Motorolas (V400, V220, T720) so I was used to those and was skeptical about getting an LG. glad I did! The screen is better than my sisters V400 (it says 128x160 pixles, but looks FAR better) the keys and phone have a good, sturdy feel. The camera is awesome for a camera phone, it looks like a 2 or 3 MP camera!!!! (no, seriously) although there are 3 keys that have to do with the camera...they're not intrusive, but i think its a little overkill. While closed, you can light up the screen, see time OR date, and flip between vibrate and normal sound. VERY conveinient. The screen is bright (inside and out) the sound of ringtones and while talking is awesome. When you turn the ringing volume up its EXTREMELY LOUD, so you never have to wish it were louder. Signal is great. The included ringtones and wallpapers arent the best (there are only 4 wallpapers) but you can get some others online. all in all, GREAT phone!!!

 review/text: I ordered this phone on the net for free with the 2 year Nationwide 450 rollover min Cingular plan. The phone is very well designed, pleasant to manage and small.

 review/summary: Pretty good, for a while
 review/text: I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?

 review/text: Overall I liked the case, but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily. Within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating. After less then two months, it plastic tab falls out entirely, dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments.It looks like I'll be looking for another case again.

 review/summary: Good case while it lasts

review/text: This case is quite nice and feels great on your hip... but do not expect it to last you the life of the phone. I bought mine around February of 2006 and used it daily until May 2006 when the nub that attaches the case to the belt clip tore out of the leather and would not be reseated. I suppose some a hot glue gun would have made it last a bit longer, but frankly by this point it was looking "used" and was not worth repairing. I do not plan to get another as a replacement. I expect a case - even a cheapo case - to last me longer than 3 months.The best part of this case is the tight fit and the magnetic closure. Both ensure that the Sidekick II will never fall out on its own, even if the case somehow becomes inverted. I once spent the better part of the day with my case pointed open-side down and the flap open, and it was held sturdily in place. The case also protects well against the wet, and the various bumps of life.

review/summary: Business suit for your Sidekick
 review/text: This case is full-grain leather with black elastic sides.It was too snug when I first opened it, but afterI stuffed it with a sweatsock and let it sit for a day,it was fine. The catch does not open accidentallyand the belt clip is very well made and seems very sturdy indeed.This case gives your Kick a rather serious/professional look.It's far more attractive than the workaday case that ships with the Sidekick. So this should be on your list if you are casting about for a pleasing replacement for the original case.

 review/summary: Motorola SLVR L6i Unlocked International
 review/text: The phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one I received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). This international version does not work everywhere I need it to work. I have AT&T service (3G) and it works in NYC, where I work, but it did not work in upstate NY. The network in upstate NY switches from 3G to EDGE. If it had 850 band, it would have worked. The phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. Amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. You might be better off getting a US version instead.

 review/text: I purchased this phone as a replacement for my slvr L2. it has better features...camera,new sleek look,added software. i fully charged it. inserted my sim card, and everything was working fine until i tried to place a call. I found i could place calls but shortly after connecting it would drop the call. so after contacting tech support they said i needed to get a new sim card and it might fix the problem. so i drive 15 mins down the road and get a new sim card just to find out that it doesnt change anything, still having dropped calls. in the end ATT said that it was the phone and it was most likley due to the fact that it was unlocked. ill never buy a unlocked phone again. as far as the phone itsself it worked fine,however im happy that i already had a motorola charger because the one that was sent in the box with the phone was european. i ended up sending it back to mobilecity and only getting a fraction of what i paid for it, due to the dumb restocking fee. so to cut this short, make sure your service provider supports unlocked phones before purchasing!!

 review/summary: The SLVR L6i
 review/text: For use outside the United States especially in Africa, one always needs a quad band unlocked cell phone like this one. I ordered and received two of these from Amazon and shipped them to my folks in Africa. They received them with joy and they jumped into jubilation when they put in their sim card and it started working at once without ant hitch like decoding or anything like that. And they made a call from it to me here in the US. Amazing isn't it? One cousin was even crazy about the ability of the phone to receive the local FM radio transmission in Africa.So then for the L6i to be described as an "International Version", was proved right when my folks got their phone working. However for use in the US please go for the ordinary L6 without the 'i'. Hahahaaaaaa!!!For People traveling outside the US and for those who are here on a short visit if you are looking for gifts for friends and family I strongly recommend this low-priced phone with camera, internet, organizer, SD slot, and FM Radio. I bought some for my friends and they are in use right now. Please buy one or more today.

A one button speakerphone with good sound quality, voice dialing (the good kind which records your voice), the ability to assign individual ring tones to contacts in your phone book, and most beautiful and wonderful and best of all, THE FONT SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 15 YEARS OLD TO READ IT! The clock on the main screen is big and easy to read, and the ring on high is actually loud enough (what a concept!?) The menu and customization features are reasonably comprehensive, and include what you need. In general, this phone is easy to hear, easy to use, easy to see (relative to most others), has clear/clean voice quality, and good reception.The negative?OK, it's not perfect. Reception may not be as good as the very best out there right now. That said, reception and transmission seem as good as most that I've tried, and quite adequate. It isn't tiny. It's about the size of my (lost) LG 6100. It's an inch thick and when the stub antenna is added, 4 inches long. The front screen is difficult to read (Pantech apparently feels that pretty is far more important than functional) and though the front screen is better than most, it could be a lot better (and by that I mean it could be easier to read as opposed to being a color screen with macroscopic font and photo caller ID)What would I change? Well, since it isn't a PDA, camera, GPS, web surfer, Ipod, video game player, it seems like it could be less chunky. An internal antenna, top quality reception/transmission, and a significantly more compact package would be nice. I'd make the front screen high contrast black on white. I like to see an option for black on white display theme (the PN-300 does include a white wallpaper choice ... indicating there is at least one genius at Pantech). A choice for a larger font size and a longer list of ring tones would be useful.Conclusion: I couldn't find any user reviews on this phone, and I was a bit worried that it would be lacking in the features I've used and seen on other current phones. I'm pleasantly surprised with this phone. It is not a stripped down minimalist, make a call only, device. The local Verizon store didn't have the PN-300 and the person I asked about it suggested it was garbage. To that salesperson, who hadn't been shaving long, I'm sure it is. To someone (over 40 crowd?) who doesn't have perfect vision or hearing, and doesn't want their phone to be a tiny personal computer, the PN-300 is an easy to use full featured cell phone, and is easily comparable to most of the current crop of LGs, Motorolas, Samsungs, etc. No, wait ... since the PN-300 does not have all the stuff apparently demanded by the under 30 crowd, it's infinitely better.

 review/text: I got this for my dad and saw him open it and use it for the first time. It's been a few weeks since Christmas and it hasn't broken or anything. It was a bit of a snug fit but the next size up would have been too big. My dad said his old one was fake leather and looked nice but started to fade and fall apart in a short period of time. This one seems more durable.

 review/text: It does exactly what it says. you can browse and save your phone files (pictures, recorded sounds, Bluetooth acquired files) to your PC. You can also update the firmware with "Sony Ericsson Update Service". It can charge your phone but you need a charger connected to the dock for this.Now the bad part, it broke after just weeks of use and I didn't treat it harshly. It's just not working anymore and there's no sign of broken parts. Good while it lasted is all I can say. As with all electric devices, you can have better luck.

review/summary: Great Idea That Did Not Work
 review/text: I bought two of these at Christmas time. The idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. The first problem was that none of the tips would fit my Motorola C261 phone. Then I tried it on a Nokia 2600. Although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when I tried to charge the phone the phone screen said STOP and had a little stop sign on it. So I assume the volts were not correct. The flash lite has two setting and worked great. Returned the items as did not work for me.

I tried to give it to my daughter and it didn't fit her phone either. I never found anyone with a phone it fit to give it to.I just use it as a wind up flashlight now. If anyone finds a source of compatible tips for other model phones that work with this, I would like to know.

 review/text: This case protects the phone from scratches and also comes with a belt clip. It is a very inexpensive case, and it does its job. However, you get what you pay for. If you would like to pay a little more, I would recommend purchasing a krussel leather case. It protects the keys on the phone, and its a little nicer looking. The leather is a little nicer that this plastic case.

 review/summary: This Case Rocks!
 review/text: I purchased this case in an effort to find a case that looked nice but did not draw too much attention to my phone. Also, I wanted it to protect my phone. This case does that. I like that fact that is fits the phone perfectly; like a glove, and does not hinder usage in any way.Another plus it the fact that the case is clear. This, I don't know if it was intentional, allows for the lights to really reflect off of the case when blinking (messages, bluetooth, etc), making the phone visible and giving it a really cool effect with the top of the case glowing in low to no light situations.The case feels nice on the phone and does not hinder putting the phone in your pocket or anything like that.I don't use the clip that came with the case because I am not one who clips my phone on my belt, but if used, it may be a tad uncomfortable as it is pretty big.

 review/summary: good looking but fragile...
 review/text: when i first received this case i was impressed with how clear it was and how sleek. it did not take any beauty away from the phone itself. however, the clip is way too big and bulky - an inch thick and does not hold well at all. for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip. the second day i had the case, it cracked in the center where the thin piece of plastic is located between the screen and trackball - and this happened from me putting my pearl in my center console on its side. then, a couple of days later it cracked again and then the middle piece broke off alltogether. the case protected the phone, since the phone did not get damaged or scratched, but the case itself needs a protector to keep it intact. so, the one star is for the good looking nature of this case but not the protection or lack thereof.

I tried to break it off as I don't use the belt clip anyway but it started to crack the rest of the plastic. oh well...you get what you pay for.

 review/text: I bought this for my blackberry pearl. It snaps right onto the phone wihtout any problems at all...it did get a little tricky when it came to puttint the clip on the back of the phone, You have to use this tacky strip and a screw to put it in this square hole...very odd but we figured it out. the clip allows you to flip the phone to a 360 degree angle, and is easy to remove from wherever you have it clipped from. It was a very good price, it is still in once piece so I would say all in all it is a good deal.

 review/text: After I ordered I received a case that was scratched with a piece snapped off. It looked used. Unfortunately since the piece was snapped the case was unusable.I called the company and they told me they never sent used stuff but would send me a replacement at no charge.The replacement didn't fit the phone... (but just barely--it was the right shape and almost the right size) after 25 minutes of attempting to get the case to fit, I got it on. Then I realized I'd left all these finger prints on the phone trying to get the case on. I wanted to take off the case and clean it but it would not come off.Finally I got it off and it snapped in the process... I tried repairing with superglue but that made part of the case opaque. Ultimately I threw the whole thing in the trash can.This case is a waste of your money. I strongly advise against buying it.

 review/text: This product is certainly durable and it has protected my phone which is what I bought it for. Unfortunately though removing it isn't easy and getting it off hurts a bit. It needs to be removed regularly to get the dust out that collects around the inside of the case from being in your bag or pocket. It would be GREAT if it still fit in a case after putting it on so that you could have the option if you wanted it to.But I'll take durability over a clean phone usually... if I HAVE to.

 review/text: I don't like the plastic belt clip but the clear cover is all I wanted anyway. By the way, you can take the plastic knob off. You just need a really small screw driver (like the kind you use to fix your glasses). The first day I put it on my Pearl, I dropped it. Not even a scratch on the cover. And for an unexpected bonus, the indicator light reflects off the clear plastic to make it easier to see if I have any messages or alerts.

 review/text: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).

 review/summary: easy, simple, but a hassle.
 review/text: i liked it at first, and it provides great protection, but LOTS of dust gets stuck in between the edges of the plastic case and the phone. It gets really unsightly and it's a bit of a hassle to unclip the case to clean out, only to have to do it again after 1 week.

 review/summary: One cent. Why not?
 review/text: For a cent, why not? You pay for it in shipping, but where don't you pay shipping these days? The case fits around the phone. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!

 review/text: We bought this battery to replace a cell phone battery which wouldn't hold a charge. Months later, with continual use, it still works perfectly.
