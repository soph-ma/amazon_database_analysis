 review/summary: Don't buy!
 review/text: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!

 review/summary: No instructions included...
 review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

 review/summary: Beware 3rd Party Cables & Sony Ericsson Tech Support
 review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

 review/summary: Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable
 review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

 review/summary: Gold Standard
 review/text: I've gone through many different bluetooth headphones. This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset. The BT820s, old school, just work. Period.

 review/text: According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices.

 review/text: The Motorola StarTAC Hands Free Car kit is outstanding. The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

Then place a couple of small (super tiny) drops of super glue on the EarGel and the Jawbone. Let it setup overnight and presto! You have a great bluetooth that stays in place. The other is to take one of the extra ear buds and take it apart and keep the ring. Place that ring inside the EarGel and glue it into place. Keep in mind you must have the correct position so when you put it on that it has the perfect fit once it is twisted.

 review/summary: Jabra gels fit well on my aliph jawbone after an accident
review/text: I accidentally tore the original factory bud off the aliph jawbone by not reading the instructions first, leaving a locking plastic ring which I saved. I bought the Jabra Clear Gels from 'Radio Snack' for under $5 and replaced the factory bud with this empty plastic ring on the jawbone, then pressed the gel piece over the ring and speaker hole to make a nice factory-like fit to the jawbone and a custom fit to my large ear canal. There was no extreme stretching of the Gel over the thin ring. The new Gel with the factory locking ring holds itself securely in my ear and the sound quality is much improved over the loose fitting factory buds.

review/summary: Fit is execellent.
 review/text: Used these to replace the painfuly uncomfortable original earpads on my Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and they're a tremendous improvement. Great that they include small, medium and large pads to ensure custom like fit. If not for these I wouldve had to chuck the earpiece in the garbage. They obviously won't fit every device out there so you maybe taking a gamble.

 review/text: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use.

 review/text: I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.

 review/summary: Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.
 review/text: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.

Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping.

 review/text: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. The set consists of 3 pairs of eargel (three sizes). Found the size that fit and inserted the ICON. Works OK, but not as snug as I would like on my right ear. Tried the left ear one and it was much better; fit was better and sound was louder. Tried several types of earphone adapters, and these seem to work better than most. If you have a problem with fit on one ear, try the other one.

 review/summary: Too Big
 review/text: Unfortunately, the ear gels in this set are all really too big for my ear. Not only that, but I can't figure out how to wear the "tab" that's on it. Does it go up, down, sideways, or at a slant to follow the "dip" my ear has just in front of the hole. And since I can't figure that out, & the fact even the small one is too big, it keeps slipping out of my ear. Thank goodness for the loop, or I'd have lost it long ago. Also, it becomes very irritating to the ridges in my ear & I usually have to take it off. I wish they still had the gels that came with the bluetooth. That one was really comfortable. This purchase turned out to be a lot more expensive than it should have been, since I now have 5 ear gels that I can't even use.

 review/summary: Great ear piece adapter
 review/text: The Jawbone bluetooth headset is a great little device, but unfortunately, none of the supplied ear pieces fit comfortable in my ear. I was all ready to return it, when I decided to try these Jabra EarGels. Well, I got them yesterday, and they make a world of difference. The Jawbone now comfortable fits in my ear, the little piece that is supposed to be touching my cheek is doing so. In fact, it is such a good fit I don't even need the other-the-ear hook any more!The EarGels come in three sizes, and are designed to fit the contours of your ear - not just to be shoved in an held in my force. Why JawBone themselves don't make something like this to come with the headset is beyond me, but at least Jabra stepped up to fill the void!

 review/summary: Best fit for jawbone era- so comfy!
 review/text: When I searched the net for a more comfortable ear piece for my jawbone era I came across this. I had read several mixed reviews about them. After a few more days of the era falling out my ear or my ear being super sore from the provided gels I took a chance.These are great. They are better than the jawbone ones in every way. They stay in my ear better. They are more comfortable. I can, also, hear the audio better.I give these five stars because they are perfect for me. If I were rating this for other folks I would probably rate it 4 stars because there are only 3 sizes. If you don't fit one it will be frustrating.

 review/summary: Completely Worthless
 review/text: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.

 review/summary: Makes Jawbone perfect
 review/text: I purchased this product after searching for ways to make Jawbone fit better. It worked!! Now my Jawbone fits perfectly, not popping/falling out of my ear. Also noticed I didn't need the volume as loud with audio directed into the ear canal. The Jawbone rests perfectly against my jaw for crystal clear conversations. It's also not necessary to keep the earpiece in the ear at all times while in standby. The eargels make the headset easy to find in your pocket/purse and put in the ear when receiving a call. I do recommend washing the earbuds with antibacterial soap and water prior to use then occasionally to reduce ear tenderness. Make sure to dry it well before putting it back on your bluetooth headset or other device.

 review/summary: Jabra Ear Gel and the Jawbone 2
 review/text: Ladies and Gentlemen..... I bought this product to go with my jawbone 2. and it is GREAT!! With this product I am able to take off the loop that comes with my jawbone and wear it all day without any problems. I actually have to turn the sound down when I wear it because it is loud. It looks so much better without the ear loop. I found the best way to figure out which size to use is to try the ear gels in your ear first until you find the right one. Be careful putting the ear gel over the Jawbone ear piece ( you dont want to tear it). There is a chance that these ear gels wont fit your ear but for the price they cost it is worth the gamble. If it fits you'll find a new level of comfort, sound quality and not to mention it looks a lot better to get rid of the ear loop.

 review/summary: The Aliph Jawbone 2 Savior
 review/text: These EarGels are the best solution bar-none to fix the comfort issue with the Aliph Jawbone 2. They make it possible to leave the jawbone in place for extreme durations. My only concern now is that my jawbone is so comfy and fixed it so well with no weight that I might fall asleep on it or take a sower with it on! To mod this onto the jawbone I simply removed the earbud O-ring and found the right size eargel for my ear. (Large in this case) then got some super glue to paint around where the O-ring attached on the jawbone, then simply placed the jawbone inside the eargel that I fitted on my ear. Left it in my ear for a few hours to dry and done. (Course I kept wearing it even after those hours were up) :)

 review/text: The eargels are functional, but they are a little awkward to put in. I've been using one with my bluetooth headset, and it certainly improves the sound. The term "gel" led me to believe they would be more comfortable than my bluetooth. However, like all headsets I've used, the gels irritate after ~30 minutes of use.

 review/summary: Excellent for use with The New Jawbone
 review/text: These eargels work with the Aliph The New Jawbone, or Jawbone 2, or the slim jawbone. I found that the earbuds provided from Aliph did not suit my ear. It was not secure even with the earloop attached. These did the trick. It was a gamble at first since i found barely any reviews on such a product with its compatibility with the New Jawbone, but it worked out for the best. These are not made for the jawbone so you are relying on its snug fit to stay in place. I removed the original eargel and replaced these onto the unit. It is snug enough for me to use without the earloop. Also its design makes the eargel stay in place in your ear. It may be tricky to fit in your ear at first but in time you'll get the feel for it. It fits my ear perfectly with the largest size. As a bonus you get multiple sizes. This is an excellent solution for those that don't have the right ear for the original gels provided for the New Jawbone.On another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel. Washing with water fixes it right up.This review is based upon purchase through Amazon and ownership for more than half a year.

 review/summary: THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS.
 review/text: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.

 review/text: I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people.

 review/text: The title says it all. Preset sizes of the EarGels just don't fit my ears. The tube that directs sound does not go in my ear canal far enough and the hook that is supposed to hold the unit in your ear will not hold it in mine. None of the 3 sizes of gels made a difference.Try before you buy if possible.

 review/summary: The REAL Jabra earbuds
 review/text: "Jabra EarGels are designed to channel sound directly into the ear for perfect reception, so conversations sound clear and natural at both ends of the call. They are made of a translucent = BLUE =, soft material shaped to sit snugly in your ear for a comfortable and secure fit. Jabra EarGels are hygienic and washable and come six in a pack - three sizes for left and right ears."That is from the Jabra website. I just added something to the blue so it would stand out and put it in CAPS. That's probably why you guys are having problems, maybe they are fakes (the clear ones). Thought I would mention it. I haven't bought any but was looking into it. What bluetooth earpieces does it fit?

 review/summary: Use for iPod earbuds
 review/text: These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying.

Came with no labels i.e., left, right, etc. or instuctions so took a little while to figure out how they would work. A small piece of paper with a few pictures and labels would have helped out tremendously. If my impatient son or daughter would have bought them they would have returned them as unuseable.

 review/text: I bought these to help with what I've read, to get the Jawbone to fit better. These ear pieces were hard to get into the ear no matter what size I tried. For a wireless earpiece you want to be able to get it on and off your ear quick if you need to, and these prevent you from doing so.

 review/summary: It will be yellow after some months. It's just an eargel don't expect anymore
 review/text: If you are planning to buy it, I can guess you have bought an "extraordinary" Jawbone. I don't know if Jabra and Jawbone are a society but it is the only one option you have to get the handsfree in your ear.I think there are several ways you can use this gel to keep your headphones comfortable in your ear, however it has to be perfectly round and inch of diameter and no more than five milimeters of depth.If you are planning to buy them because you are planning to use it with a "wonderful" Jawbone, please consider other market options for BT handsfree.However if you have a very unconfortable and little headphones or an already bought Jawbone, it would be your unique solution. But maybe you won't ever need it if you look for a better BT handsfree device.

 review/summary: A good idea, but not a proper fix
 review/text: Kudos to the dude/dude-ette who figured out that the Jabra ear gels might improve the bad, painful and ineffective stock rubber covers provided with your Jawbone product. The Jabra gels aren't a perfect solution for my Icon-Hero, but they're heaps better than the original earbud-nonsense supplied with the bluetooth unit (which I totally dig). Still, the drama of finding a way to "rig" a $100 electronic device from a reputable manufacturer so that it doesn't hurt your ear is not cool. Aliph-Jawbone are you listening? I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit. Once you work that out, give it a chance as you and your ear may need a moment to adjust to how it feels. The volume improvement is nice too. Good luck.

 review/summary: Good solution for Jawbones that don't fit
review/text: If you have trouble getting your Jawbone to fit like I did, these may be a good solution for you. The largest one worked great for me. I wear it without the ear loop now. However, you can do a number of different combination with/without earloop and with/without the original ear buds attached to achieve your perfect fit. The other nice thing is that these sit in your ear and blocks out more outside noise so you can actually hear better. I found myself turning the volume down a bit after using these.

 review/summary: didn't quite work out
 review/text: As suggested by another reviewer, I purchased these ear gels to go along with my Jawbone, to assist in keeping the bluetooth headset in my ear and on my head. Unfortunately, contradictory to what the other reviewer indicated, the ear gels did not even come close to fitting over the ear piece on the Jawbone, and thus were pretty much useless to me. In fact, one of the gels even split open as I was trying to make it fit over the earpiece on the Jawbone. Maybe it's because I have smaller ear, and I had to use the smallest one, but it totally didn't work for me. Oh well, at least they weren't too expensive.

 review/summary: Very Comfortable
 review/text: I've used these ear gels on several products and have been very pleased with their comfort. I currently use them to on my Aliph Jawbone. They work well and there's no problem with hearing callers; however, if you think the Jawbone is difficult to get on with one hand you definitely don't want to add the ear gels and continue using the ear loop. Using the loop and gels in combination is a 2-handed endeavor and even then can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. I continue to use the loop because when I used the gel alone, I felt like the earpiece would not stay in securely in my ear. With the loop and the gel, the earpiece is snug and secure, even in the harshest (I drive a Jeep and take the top off) winds; and is comfortable to wear.

 review/text: I use these on the Aliph Jawbone so it's not surprise they're not perfect matches to each other. The eargels fit over the speaker nub on the Jawbone it's not exactly secure and I find the eargels fall off occasionally. I was also expecting these to act more like earplugs, that snugly fit in your ear canal but that isn't the case. However, the eagels do fit quite comfortably. I would imagine they're pretty good on the headset for which they were designed. They're nice and soft and molded to fit most ears, I would think (they fit mine pretty well). They're just little pieces of plastic so I'm not sure what else to say about them. If you're current headset is uncomfortable, I'd say go ahead and buy a set of these. They're not very expensive and you might find a good solution!

 review/summary: Works great with Jawbone Era!!
 review/text: I finally settled on my Jawbone Era after using many bluetooth headsets. It is the loudest, clearest, and best noise cancelling headset of all.The only problem is that the earbuds that come with it really such. They don't fit well and hurt my ear. Also, I don't like using the earloop to hold it in place.This is where the Jabra eargels come in. Install the Jabra eargel on top of the small or medium earbud of Jawbone, and you're set.I couldn't love my Jawbone Era any more. It fits better. It is louder to the extent I actually have to adjust the volume.

 review/summary: Better than standard earpiecs but not great
 review/text: I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says "what?" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this.

 review/text: I got them for my bluetooth, because I don't like them hanging on my ear and jiggling around. This works great when I can get them in right. No instructions on the proper way to where them, so I am guessing. Sometimes I get them in perfect and there great - other times they frustrate me. I guess after getting experience with them I'll be able to pop them in with no problem.

 review/summary: GREAT FIT AND MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT JAWBONE OFFERS !!!!
 review/text: I BOUGHT THE JAWBONE 2 SOON AS IT CAME OUT. THE JAWBONE 2 CAME OUT WITH SOME " NEW AND IMPROVED" EARBUDS, HOWEVER THEY ONLY WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THEN THE JAWBONE 2 WOULD NOT STAY IN MY EAR. THIS WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYING SINCE THE JAWBONE 2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE "TOP OF THE LINE".THEN I BEGAN TO SEARCH THE INTERNET AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE EARGELS. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THEY FIT GREAT INSIDE MY EAR; NO SLIPPING AND SLIDING, HAVING TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST THEM. I PUT THEM IN ONCE AND GO.HOWEVER AFTER WEARING THE SAME EARGEL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS ONCE I TAKE THE JAWBONE OUT OF MY EAR THE EARGEL WILL SLIP OFF. THIS HAS NOT BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM I JUST SLIP THE EARGEL BACK ON WHEN I GET READY TO PUT THE JAWBONE BACK IN MY EAR, AND IT STAYS PUT. THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH BUYING IF YOU HAVE THE JAWBONE 1 OR 2. THE DIFFERENCE IS NIGHT AND DAY. GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!

 review/text: I have a Samsung WEP200 which is a nifty little headset but felt awkward in my ear. These eargels improved both the fit and comfort of my headset. I love that they come in three sizes for each ear so there's something for everyone. My only beef: $8.87 is highway robbery for these things! I picked them up at a RadioShack store for about $2; you're better off doing the same.

 review/summary: Way too large!
 review/text: Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.

 review/text: These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.

 review/text: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.

 review/summary: JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES
 review/text: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone.

 review/text: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.

 review/summary: Ears to you!
 review/text: Product arrived much quicker than expected. I have a Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece, and I keep breaking the ear-loop, and I could not find replacement parts. Not wanting to give up my Jawbone (and rather not buy a new one) I thought I would first give the Jabra EarGels a try... and I'm glad I did! My earpiece not only stays in place without the ear-loop, it just functions better. I CANNOT shake it off my head. It actually isolates the sound better into my ear. With 6 provided (3 left and 3 right) finding the perfect fit was easy (you will need to use the original ear cushion in addition to the EarGel for two of the EarGels to fit best with the earpiece) - all and all... a five-star product, and company!

 review/text: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.

 review/text: I have a motorola H695 bluetooth which I managed to adapt to use with the eargels, what a difference! I can hear better, I threw out the ear loop which I no longer need at all. The earpiece stays in very well. I use a large one with the bluetooth and I used the medium ones for my earphones which cuts out more of the background noise so I need less volume. The come with a set of three sizes sm med lg for both ears so you get 6 all together. Normally I have a problem with the earbud type earphones irritating my ear so I was suprised that the large eargel fits my ear the best.

 review/summary: So much better than "over the ear"
 review/text: I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.

 review/text: You can avoid the annoying over the ear adapter and switch to a partial in the ear gel that allows you to hear the message clearly in almost all reasonable situations without high volumes. It does a pretty good job staying in place, too. I have used the same adaptor for years with my old corded Jabra and car conversations have never been easier. If you don't mind having something in your ear this is great.

 review/summary: Don't waste your money
 review/text: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them.

 review/summary: Complete garbage
 review/text: I bought these Jabra Eargels from another retailer, because I thought they had the colored ones, which are supposedly more durable than their clear counterparts. Well, they did not have the colored ones, but the clear ones I received from them were horrible junk. I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through. I returned them, and who would blame me? See the title, this product is complete garbage.

 review/text: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments. If you work or play anywhere it is loud, you need these! I have since upgraded these to a custom earpiece, but if I hadn't gotten the Jabra's, I most likely would have chucked the Jawbone as unusable!

 review/summary: Not well suited for the Jawbone II
 review/text: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.

 review/summary: Perfect for use with BlueAnt wireless earpiece
 review/text: Didn't like the earloop that comes std with the BlueAnt bluetooth headset so I purchased a package of the eargels. My earpiece now comfortably fits in my ear and I can hear the call much better. It took a couple of tries to figure out which was the right size to use, so I was thankful for the variety. It takes a couple of days to get used to (feeling was slightly annoying at first) but the trade offs are totally worth it and my ear got used to it in no time.

 review/summary: They fit nicely in the ear, but don't work so well with jawbone
 review/text: I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.

 review/summary: Perfect for Jawbone 2
 review/text: Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssassin-Jawbone II (Black)[Retail Packaged]Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssasin-Jawbone II (Silver)[Retail Packaged]These ear buds fir snugly over the stem of the Jawbone II and fit snugly, comfortably in my ear. They were necessary for me to use the Jawbone as it requires both good ear fit and good jaw contact to work at all. Many, like me, cannot achieve both fits with the ear loops and buds that come with the Jawbone.In a perfect world there would be a Jabra gel half way in size between medium and large, but either works well for my ear. I suspect most ears would find a comfortable functional fit with at least one of the three sizes they sell (3 sizes, left and right per package). They only cost a few dollars.

 review/summary: Somewhat disappointed
 review/text: I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional.

 review/summary: The perfect thing to make the Jawbone Bluetooth headset fit - without the ear loop
 review/text: I was in hell with my Jawbone until I got these. I think I need to glue the thing on with a little Superglue, which I haven't. I keep it in a little pouch in my purse with my phone so it doesn't matter if it falls off...but gluing it on would fix it. But it makes my Jawbone fit perfectly and stay in my ear, and no earloop -- I've removed the dumb earloop altogether. You have to experiment with the sizes and play around with the fit at first, then it becomes second nature.Oh, and you have to remove the Jawbone earthingy -- the rubbery piece -- which is accomplished easily enough by turning it and pulling it off. It's on a little track, and turns like a jar lid.

 review/summary: Just OK but better than what Jawbone provides
 review/text: I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people.

 review/summary: Instructions on how to use with Jawbone
 review/text: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

 review/summary: Works great for Samsung WEP200
review/text: I purchased a Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset for my wife for Christmas. She liked it okay, but the OEM ear pieces did a poor job of holding the headset in her ear-it kept falling out, and she had difficulty hearing calls. I noted in Amazon's reviews for the item that some customers had bought Jabra EarGels to rectify the problem, so I took the suggestion to heart and purchased a set for her. As advertised, the EarGels resolved the issue: my wife now is very happy with the headset, and can hear calls just fine.

review/summary: Caution - Jabra Clear Ear Gels & Jawbone
 review/text: I recently purchased a Jawbone bluetooth headset. Works great. Ear fit was a little loose and I found myself pushing it more into my ear to hear better. Having seen the suggestions and other reviews to use the Jabra Clear Ear Gels, I decided to try some. Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet.

 review/text: On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.

 review/summary: I need two sizes!
 review/text: I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)

 review/summary: Everyone's ears are different
 review/text: With three different sizes and both left &amp; right options, almost everyone should be able to find a good fit within this package. Without a properly fitted earbud, the Jabra headsets just don't work well. I suggest you pick these up at this price, because they *do* tend to fall off every once in a while and disappear under the car seat. Having a spare on hand is a must.

 review/text: The problem that plagues the Jawbone is the fit. With these ear gels, the problem is gone and I don't need to use the ear hook. You will need to make sure that that the gel piece on the Jawbone touches your cheek and you will be good to go.I am using the Large sizes for my ears. Does anyone want to trade for the other sizes: small/medium? I figure that I'll never need those. Thanks.

 review/summary: Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets.
review/text: Excellent product. I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.

 review/text: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]

 review/text: I recently purchased a Aliph Jawbone BT headset. #1 BT Headset on the market IMHO. I wasn't wild about the piece that goes around your ear however. I never have been. So I picked up a pack of the Jabra EarGels. Best decision of my life. I pulled the plastic ring that snaps onto the Jawbone out of one of the earpieces that comes with it and stuck it inside the EarGel. Snapped it onto the Jawbone, and bingo. Instant comfort. Can't go wrong. Great product!

 review/summary: Very comfy and effective
 review/text: Bought these based on a recommendation from another site for a badly shaped earplug for a headphone I bought. The three sets (sizes) are really nice in that it allows some variety. The shape of these really funnel the sound into your ear, which is nice and helps with outside sound. The fit in the ear means that it will hold most headsets in your ear comfortably without a hook or other method from the headset.The nodule on the bottom fits over most earpiece sized rods - I've easily put it over one as big as a in-ear headphone jack and as small as the rod on my LG headset from work (which was far too small for every other one I found).

Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !

 review/summary: Ear Gels
 review/text: These work great and they fit more than just the Jabro products. They fit most standard ear buds. I use mine on my Bluetooth ear piece and the sound really does funnel into your ear canal, and it fits well enough that I no longer need the annoying over ear piece to hold it in place.

 review/summary: Jabra Eargels are better than the big round ear speaker
 review/text: the small is too small and the medium is almost too big - but those both fit in your ear and direct the sound so you can hear it good without it falling out of your ear. I used it on a samsung corded headphones that came with an instinct phone. the headphones round design is too big for normal ears and these helped. it's not a perfect fit is reason gave it 3 stars.it's priced right, but the $5 shipping is a rip-off. It could easily have shipped for under $2.

 review/summary: Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.
review/text: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.

 review/text: The ear plugs are comfotable, but are easily dislodged from the head set. The combination of the earplugs and headset are troublesome to put on. Many times the earplug becomes unattached in the process so one starts over.

 review/summary: Good for use with Jawbone
 review/text: My boyfriend purchased these eargels based on other reviews on the Jawbone BT headset which indicated that these could assist with fit issues. I have not personally used the eargels, but my boyfriend loves them and is glad that he can wear his Jawbone comfortably and securely by using them. Amazon is a good place to buy these as we could not find them in traditional stores like Best Buy et al.

 review/summary: Decent alternative to the Jawbone "new fit" earbuds
 review/text: I love my Jawbone II but using the earloop was an issue with my glasses. I first tried out these Jabra EarGels and they worked decently. I especially felt like everything would fall out when I opened my mouth wide (yawning for example). Overall they were adequate and got the job done but now that Aliph is selling their own "new fit" ear gels I find I haven't been using the Jabras anymore. Aliph's fit my ear better.

 review/summary: Great for the jawbone
 review/text: For me, it fits well on my jawbone1. I just had to take off the jawbone ear hanger and ear piece, and put this rubber earpiece over it. When it's in my ear, I can jump up and down (not that there's a usual reason to) and it doesn't come off. I'm using the largest size for the right side. Just don't keep it in the car when it's hot outside, the rubber might get a little soft and come off the Jawbone. let it cool and it's back to normal.

 review/summary: Very functional, not very pretty
 review/text: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.

 review/summary: Jabra/Jawbone EarGels
 review/text: turned out good. took a little bit to get used to it but works fine no loop anymore required which is good considering I broke all the other ones I had. Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now..

 review/text: This is a must have for anyone that spends a lot of time in their vehicle. I had used all of the plug in ear accessories and they work well for short conversations and a short period of time. However, nothing compares to this. You place the phone in the cradle and thats it, it does the rest. While the phone is in the cradle, and the ignition is on, it is being charged. The phone can also be set to answer on its own when a call comes in and it will even mute the radio. I give this an excellent rating.

 review/summary: Excellent Product
 review/text: This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional "post" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!

 review/summary: Great product -- needs professional install unless very savy
 review/text: This is one product that you'll wonder how you survived without it. It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit. The only thing bad about it was that the Nokia 5165 phone was basically free for me but the hands-free unit cost alot more ...

review/summary: Safer Driving and Easier Communications
 review/text: I bought and installed the Nokia car kit (CARK-91) for my Nokia phone. Now, it is a real pleasure and quite safe to talk and drive. I often hold conference calls in my car on the way into the office. When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels. The cradle is strong and sturdy, and, with the phone attached, does not look out of place next to the steering wheel. Combined with Nokia's quick dial features, the car kit makes using a phone in the car relatively safe.

 review/summary: Simple, and a great value.
 review/text: Once again Nokia had their end user in mind when they designed a simple, useful and durable product in their mobile phone holder. I used it for over a year before I sold my car with the phone holder installed in it. I hope the new owner is using a Nokia phone, because I miss it. I have purchased a complete car kit and will install it in my new car this weekend, but in the meantime while I am fumbling with my phone in the car, (of course I'm using a headset), I realize how great the holder was. (...) There is nothing to think about except: where are you going to install it? Consistent with the sharp design and great support of their products, the low priced, functional mobile phone holder is another winner for Nokia.

 review/summary: An absolute must-own for Nokia users.
 review/text: Like most cell phone users, I had two chargers for my phone: The supplied wall-wart charging transformer, and the accessory mobile charging cord. The wall wart rarely got used- I'd have to find it, unroll the cord, reach down to plug it into the wall, etc. Not a very handy device. The mobile charger was much more convenient- if I remembered to use it, and if it was in the car I was driving. Oops, left the charger in the van. Oops, forgot to connect it. More than once I arrived at the office with a nearly dead phone.I bought this little stand on a whim, really, but it's turned out to be the single most useful accessory I ever purchased for a cell phone. Now, when I come home, I immediately drop the phone in the charging stand at my desk. When I leave the house, I grab the phone and it's always fully charged. I haven't used the mobile charging cord since buying this stand. I haven't had to.

I'd purchase this again however, as it's $3 instead of the $8 for the one with the light-up M.

Anyway as one of the review said, it is not different from what is shown on the website and I assume it will also work without any problem ..

 review/text: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.

 review/summary: Motorola car charger OEM?
review/text: The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)

 review/text: It's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be OEM. All of the OEM chargers I've seen (model number SYN0847) has glowing stylized "M" motorola logo. This item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the "M" that glows when it's plugged in. All of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic Motorola. Maybe a really good knockoff? Anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.

Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to.

 review/summary: Typical Motorola quality
 review/text: Interesting shape and blue light that glows when this unit is plugged into the cigarette lighter. Can't believe that I've paid 5x as much for off brand car chargers in the past. Some have come apart, some have stopped working after shorting out. This Motorola charger feels like a quality piece and appears to be one that will last. Have no idea why anyone would buy an off brand when you can have legendary Motorola quality with a cool looking shape/light. Can't think of one thing that would improve this charger. The price is the best part!! Highly recommend!

 review/summary: Won't Recharge Anything
 review/text: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.

 review/summary: Great Value for the Money
 review/text: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.

 review/summary: it charges..
 review/text: it's a charger - it charges your device - i dont even know what else to write - i actually use this one for my blackberry, not a moto device but since this has a regular mini-usb connector and accompanying voltage, it should work on any device that takes a mini-usb charger

 review/summary: Well made product at fair price
 review/text: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.

 review/summary: Motorola Razr V3 charger
 review/text: I ordered this charger for use with my wife's Motorola Razr V3 phone. I have had problems in the past with some chargers not working with this phone, perhaps due to the wiring within the USB connector. I received this charger within a couple days of ordering it, and it works perfect with the Razr.

 review/text: This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for.

 review/text: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.

 review/summary: Phone great but......
 review/text: Love phone. Sleak design and not over burden with bells and whistles. However, Amazon and Cingular (AT&T) need to better coordinate the option of extending your Cingular contract with purchase of new phone from Amazon. Cingular over charged me $59.99 a month for an additional new plan....instead of extending my "family plan" contract for 24 months. Cingular customer service was terrible, Amazon on the otherhand was great. It took a day or two but they gave me a special Cingular number and my problem was solved. A great deal on a new phone but watch your phone bill closely.

 review/text: As someone else commented, the ear buds tend to fall out once in a while as they're a bit big. 4-stars only because I bought these for $9 inc. shipping but not worth buying if you have to pay upwards of $20. Buy an adapter instead and use iPod or Sony buds.PS: Haven't used them for making a call yet.

The cover fits like a glove and keeps my phone from sliding around and helps absorb the daily bumps my phone gets.The cover is well worth the money.The only problem is that the hole for the SD card door is not larger enough to allow you to open the door and take out the SD card without taking the cover off or you have to take a razor blade and enlarge the cell phone cover opening.

The skin isn't as thick as the OEM iSkin I use for my iPod. And like the black iSkin, you can easily see all the white lint and fuzz it attracts. But overall for the price, it's a good value. SHIPPING: Ordered Sunday night. BargainCell shipped it Thursday (they're based in southern California), received Friday.

 review/text: Fits ok. Stretches on easily (does not snap). No cut outs for any of the buttons on the middle of the phone (Palm Treo 755p) Can't see the power, green, five way, or the menu buttons. You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small. OK for now, but will keep looking for one that fits correctly.

 review/text: Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case.

 review/text: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain.

 review/summary: Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset in Orange
 review/text: Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked "bulk" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a "Motomanual." From all appearances it was brand new.

 review/summary: Good deal. Decent earpiece for the price. Has some minor issues.
 review/text: I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is "on" or "off". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not "sit" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did.

 review/summary: AARRRGH! It's... cool.
 review/text: This is a fabulous device. It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it.

 review/summary: Decent headset with comfortable fit, but tinny sound
review/text: Overall, my experience with this headset is positive. The sound is completely missing low frequencies, but you get used to that and voice clarity does not suffer.Fit is very comfortable, once you rotate the rubber stub to just the right angle (different angles for different ears). I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless.

review/summary: Small, Maybe Too Small
 review/text: This was my first attempt with a Bluetooth headset and I came away with the "just not right for me" impression. The AX2 is very small, but sound quality is generally good, with one exception. While I could hear callers just fine, it was next to impossible for me to hear the verbal commands from the phone. I also had a hard time operating the volume buttons. The only way to change volume was to take the headset from the ear. Overall, not a bad headset, just was not the one for me.

 review/summary: Highly Recommanded for People who wear glasses 6 STARS!
 review/text: For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

 review/summary: Best headset there is while it lasts...
 review/text: I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????

 review/summary: Great for the size, but average for the sound
 review/text: I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the "antenna" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality.

The AX2's funny looking earpiece is ajustable and can be cut to fit almost any ear. As far as the quality, are their better headsets out there... Yes, but are there better headsets out there for the money, I don't think so. I put a strong buy on this BT headset.

review/summary: Worth about what you pay
 review/text: Pros:Pairing was easy. The thing does work, and is usable as an entry-level Bluetooth headset. Loved the mechanism by which it fits in your ear; that's very comfortable and secure at the same time.Cons:You pretty much get what you pay for. It looks nice, but it feels flimsy. When you plug the charger in, it feels like it doesn't fit, or you're putting it in wrong. That isn't a big problem, but it feels like a symptom of a cheaply made product.The performance of the AX2 I received was such that I thought it was defective and I sent it back for an exchange. It seemed like the connection between the headset and the phone was almost always plagued with bad static, the connection was dropped quite often, and people I spoke to while using the headset often complained that they could barely hear me.However, the replacement unit Amazon sent me (kudos to their return process and customer service, by the way) behaved exactly the same way, which tells me that this is just how this model is.In the end, I returned it and bought the just-released Plantronics Discovery 665, with AudioIQ (Amazon sells this, too, but I bought mine from Sprint). The difference is night and day. Of course, the Plantronics also costs several times as much, so it had darn well better perform.Overall, I'd say the AX2 is an okay deal if you buy it at Amazon's discounted price (do not go pay retail for this thing, it isn't nearly worth it and there are dozens of better models at the same price point), and you're only a casual user of the thing.

 review/summary: cool headset!
 review/text: I have had NO problems hearing or being heard with the Bluespoon. I love that it is so small and not very noticable. I also wear glasses quite a bit so I like that it doesn't go over the outside of the ear like a lot of them do. But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable. I'm so used to it now, I hardly notice it and it doesn't bother me at all. Everyone that sees mine wants one!

 review/summary: Inexpensive, outperforms most others
 review/text: This little dandy was quite a suprize in ease of use and performance.Pros:Very light. It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it.

 review/summary: Good product for the price you pay
 review/text: Let's start with the product's biggest advantage: for $37 (shipping & taxes), you've got a bona fide bluetooth headset. For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain.

 review/summary: Bluespoon, ehh works for me...I guess
review/text: Okay, this is the first and only bluetooth I bought/own - and I'm yes amazed at how small it is and how it's still able to be so clear. I use it for me ps3, not cell phone and it works great. The RED FLAG that I give on this piece, is that it hurts my ear - my ear gets sore after just a little while. I've cut the tail short, shorter and shorter, no help. Anyhow, I'm sure that's different for everyone as nobody has the same ear shape. All in all, besides a little red ear, I'm happy with it lol.-Govna-

 review/summary: I love it so much I've bought two.
 review/text: I paid [a dollar amount over twice what Amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if I put it here] for one at [a store the name of which Amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like I did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. Over the years I've tried headsets from AT&T;, Body Glove, Hello Direct, Jabra, and Plantronics, and I find the Bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, Jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and Plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on Earth).The soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). A good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. It weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it IN your ear, not just ON it.Once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. I don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). And once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. I have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.I had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the Bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. The headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. Once I got the phone replaced that problem went away. So if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. It might just be your phone.I bought a second one from Amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- I could turn the volume up, but not down. I've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now I have two that work. I've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.Pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; Bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.Minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.A minus only on paper: no noise reduction. In my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. I'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.

 review/summary: Great Earpiece - Still Some Issues
 review/text: This is my second Bluespoon AX2. The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did. Unfortunately the warranty is only 2 weeks - the shortest warranty period I have ever heard of.

 review/summary: Pretty good for the money.
 review/text: After two weeks of use, I'd have to say it's not that bad... Especially for the price! My Bluetooth 1.1 Sanyo Katana can't get more than 4 or 5 feet away but inside that and the clearity is great both in and out. Battery life is longer than my phone so that a plus. I really like the little tail thingy on the ear piece because it does a good job of securing the headset to my ear. I rarely have to turn the volume up all the way on the headset, and I don't have to speak loudly for the other end to hear me. The tiny size is awsome!The bad:The multi function button tends to shift and rattle a bit and every time I move my head and hear it, I think "cheap"The flashing blue LED is too bright in the car at night.Wind noise is a problem with this headset.I wouldn't steer anyone away from this headset who is looking for a low priced unit. Would I buy another one? It's possible. :)

 review/summary: Good idea, poor execution
 review/text: I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button "countersunk" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.

 review/summary: Very good product but not durable
 review/text: I was very happy with the bluespoon AX2 performance and ergonomics but was disappointed with its durability.The AX2 is incredibly small, light, and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable...

 review/text: AX2 is very unnoticeable and comfortable when you wear it. It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work. Overall, I like it and it works for me.

 review/summary: Who cares how cheap it is if IT DOESN'T WORK!!!
 review/text: After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

 review/text: This is the first and only bluetooth product that I have ever purchased....so I don't have anything to compare to. I would just say that for the money (19.95 + tax) that this product is well worth the money. I have great reception and everone can hear me very well and I can also hear anyone that I'm talking to very well.I have read many other reviews about this product and I don't have any of the problems that everyone else is having. The unit fits snug in my ear and it isn't loose at all. I have had to run yet while wearing it, but, I feel that if I had to that the unit would stay put. I haven't actually measured the distance that I can get from my Sony Eriksen Z525a phone but I feel that 20-30 feet is accurate and still maintain reception.My wife has a Motorola H500 bluetooth product that she uses with a Motorola phone. I feel that my Nextlink AX2 performs just as well and is about $30.00 cheaper in price.I would recommend the Nextlink AX2 highly.

 review/summary: Great headset
 review/text: I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.

 review/summary: "You Get What You Pay For"!
 review/text: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -"you get what you pay for"

 review/summary: too good to be true... almost
 review/text: this headset kicks! i dont even want to call it a 'headset', cuz it's waay too small for that.it's available online for about 20 US bucks, and it's worth 10 times that, easily.after using a Jabra BT200 with my newy aquired motorola L2, i wanted something smaller, so i found this little nugget. the Jabra worked quite well, mind you, but was a little too big of a gizmo than i wanted to sling up off the top side of my ear.the bluespoon AX2 is unbelieveable. it felt, literally, like it wasn't there. it communicated (bluetoothed) to my phone seamlessly. it communicated to me (thru some beeps and chirps) flawlessly.it took about three days of heavy use to get the 'set comfy in my ear, yet comfy or not it was always very secure and clear, both incoming and outgoing. it sicks in your via one of two (lg or sm)"soft springs" which are just soft rubber thingys that follow the inner contours of your ear.(this thing held on even when my own glasses fell off my head!) (thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public. (not everybody knows what a borg is..)so if you're looking for a cheap, light, comfortable, reliable, geeky, borg-like headset that's worth every penny, get a freakin sweet bluespoon ax2 beeootch!

 review/summary: still looking for my ideal headset
 review/text: Here's what I like about the headset:1. Extremely lightweight, with secure fit. It's easy to forget you have this on because it is so light. The soft spring easily fits into your ear and secures it. With the hook type headsets, there is some play during side-to-side head movement. This fits snugly in the ear and normal movements do not feel loose or unsecured. You do notice the speaker piece after it's been in your ear for more than a few hours, but it's not painful, just a little sore as there is only one size. I generally don't keep the headset in all day anyway, and only realized it because I had forgotten it was in.2. Incoming sound is very loud. It's in-ear design and fit allows you to hear very well. It's one headset I've used that I actually don't want at full volume.3. Has lots of ways to connect and conference calls. You can control switching from headset to handset from the headset, or connecting more than one call through the buttons.4. The blue talk light turns red when the battery is low, giving you a visual warning.Not so great:1. Lots of static in the bluetooth connection. I have my cellphone on my belt clipped on the left, and use the headset on the right ear. I do tend to notice this more when I am near a wifi source, but not always. I've also noticed it away from wifi signals (like my car). I've had the headset for about a week, and am still trying to figure out why a 3' distance on a 30' BT device would have so much problem with a clear connection.2. While the volume is loud, the sound quality is poor. My Motorola H500 wasn't nearly as loud, so I can't hear well when it's noisy, but the sound quality is much better. The AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies are boosted. While it may make voices easier to hear, it also sounds tinny and unnatural.3. Build quality is very mediocre. It's plastic, and I dropped it from waist level onto the parking lot surface. One of the volume buttons popped off, and the battery compartment was half popped out, as well as the plastic halves loosened. So now I don't have a volume button. I'd heard others say this unit breaks easily, and I can believe it might not have survived a drop from ear level.4. Headset tends to echo, although I don't know if it's worse than other BT sets. My Motorola echoed, but not quite as much as this. I don't notice it, but the person I call will mention it.5. The first day the power on/off tone was clearly audible. I don't know what happened, but after the first day the tone is muted so much I have to listen closely to hear the unit power on or off.I am still on the hunt for my ideal bluetooth set. Will try out the noise cancelling mics or bone conduction technology next because the older mic technology this represents leaves much to be desired.

 review/summary: great tiny headset!
 review/text: i had originally bought the motorola hs820. i was using it with a moto krzr. i don't know if my particular headset was faulty, but the sound quality was horrendous. everything sounded tinny and even synthesized. someone told me that bluetooth just doesn't sound right with a moto phone. i returned that and bought this headset anyway (it's so cheap and amazon returns are very simple, that i decided to give it another go). i was shocked when i saw how small it is (you don't realize just from the pictures). it's incredibly comfortable in my ear, and the sound quality is just as it is from the phone. no difference at all, and people on the other end don't notice i'm using a headset. i recommend buying this over any others. it's definitely worth it!

 review/summary: Great! ...for awhile
 review/text: When I first bought this headset in April 2006, it was amazing. It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it. I'm thinking about trying the new Samsung WEP200, as it's a similar small, in-ear design, which is one of the best features of this headset.

 review/summary: Not durable at all...move on to another headset
 review/text: I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another.

review/text: This BT headset is relatively small and unobtrusive compared to others I've seen. It is easy to use, the sound quality is acceptable and it fit my ear comfortably. After getting it, however, I realized that I really wasn't in love with the whole BT earpiece fad (people walking around, apparently talking to themselves, with a big plastic wart hanging out of their ear) - so I rarely use it. The only real complaint I can muster is that it is somewhat sensitive to wind noise and best used indoors or an enclosed area. If you have abnormal ears - it might not fit as well for you.

 review/summary: Great case
 review/text: This is the second Armour Case I have bought for a Palm PDA; prior to this I had used the Palm brand had cases. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Armour Case I purchase, not because of the case but because the Palm PDA's are no longer being made. Having said that, I would get it again in a minute if I had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the Palm-made hard cases I have used do. It has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning I can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the Palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). Having TWO Palm PDA's stolen in the last year (Note to thieves: these are NOT phones, guys!), I was lucky to still be able to get a Palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. But, I doubt I'll be able to get another Palm PDA if it happens again, which is unfortunate.

 review/summary: safe palm
 review/text: I've used this case for over a year now. I carry my palm all the time in my jeans pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times.The catch that holds it closed works well, not hard to open (though with two hands). If I stick too many receipts in the back of the case the catch won't catch.Possible downside? The hinge opens along the long side like a book, so if you use it oriented that way the case kinda gets in the way. If you use it turned the other way (my preference) the case sits nicely in my hand for writing-awesome.Never used the belt clip, I've had terrible luck with those things no matter what they're attached to (phone, ipod, whatever..)

 review/summary: Way exceeded expectations.
 review/text: When I got my new Palm TX, I knew I wanted a hard metal case. I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one.

 review/summary: Better than the Palm case by a mile.
 review/text: One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.

 review/summary: Sturdy Protective Case
 review/text: I have had this case for about 7 months and I am satisfied with its performance. It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case.

 review/summary: Acceptable case
 review/text: I purchased this case based on the reviews here, and on my own prior bad experience with a Palm case. This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force.

 review/summary: Excellent Product
 review/text: This is my second metal TX case (the other one was a different brand). I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment.

 review/text: This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.

 review/summary: A few details were lacking, but the best I've seen far...
review/text: I purchased this after having a cracked screen on my TX, and paying a bundle for repairs. The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book. You cannot fold it back, behind the palm, out of the way.All in all I'm pretty happy, and haven't seen anything better. It looks like it will work well. I just see room for improvement.

 review/text: I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made.

 review/summary: Palm TX Armor case is okay but...
 review/text: The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments.

 review/summary: Great protective armor case, better than the original case.
 review/text: I think that it simply does what the manufacturer says it does, which is to protect the Palm, and in my case I've found that it is so. I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it.

 review/summary: Went through my snowblower.
 review/text: This story tops them all. I have dropped my Palm TX over and over with the Palm TX case. It's kind of banged up. The belt clip is kind of worn out. The springing thing won't hold it very well any more. The other day I got home from work and it was almost dark so I had to hurry and do some snowblowing. I heard a bump sound and didn't realize my Palm fell off the belt clip. I ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. I didn't realize it until I dug it out of the snow two days later. The TX was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. I snapped it closed and the TX still works fine! Just had to get a new stylus. Weird, because my first TX died on me with no bumping around and I got this replacement one under warranty.

 review/text: Bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. Other reviewers have had the same experience. The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again.

 review/text: The Palm fits into the cover securely and perfectly. The cover snaps closed a bit stiffly at first but after a week clicks shut easily and securely. Light slim solid case that takes a dropping well. Front cover has clearance so Palm's screen is not impacted at all. Two slots in front cover hold standard SD cards. Looks like there is enough clearance so cards will not press onto Palm's screen but I haven't tested that. Recessed access to top and bottom connection points on the Palm provide protection without ever having to take the Palm out of the case. It's very functional.

 review/summary: Worth It
 review/text: The case design is awesome, but steer clear of the metallic version. It scratches easily. Now I've got the black version and LOVE it. I like how the case protects my entire Palm TX. Not one corner of my TX extends beyond the case so if I ever drop it, it may be jostled, but not totally destroyed. The cut outs give you ample room to work with when turning it off or on and using cords, memory cards, or the stylus. There's even a little cut-out in the back for the speaker. The case latch is solid and doesn't pop open. Inside, there's a soft felt lining and slots for 2 memory cards. I don't use the belt clip, so this case is just fine for me and the price is right too.

 review/text: The aluminum case was disappointing. It looks like black plastic. Two of us struggled and struggled to get the Palm TX to fit in the case. After repeated attempts, we gave up and I e-mailed Boxwave. Finally after reading someone else's review, I realized that the funny piece in the middle of the case was supposed to slide into the TX. It worked fine after that. The box was labeled for the Palm Tungsten, not the TX. Simple instructions with the case, would've saved me a couple of hours of fiddling and e-mails. I agree with another reviewer who said the case is slippery also. I probably would not buy this again, but will keep it now that I have it.

 review/summary: Not good for the Palm TX
 review/text: I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such).

 review/summary: lose the belt clip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 review/text: I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip. It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat. This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well. It flops and swirls around. Otherwise, the case would be fine. I do not recommend.

 review/text: This is a very nice looking case. The PDA fits snugly and doesnt slide around. The latch on my case seems very secure and takes some effort to open. As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases. I dont rely on them.The main thing I dislike about this case is that it opens to the left, not the right like other cases Im used to. A minor thing that I can get used to.

I would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. Look elsewhere!!!

 review/summary: Could be better
 review/text: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.

 review/summary: Great Headset, Poor Fit
 review/text: This was my first bluetooth headset I purchased, and I made sure I researched it before I bought it. All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution. Great headset.

 review/text: This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer &quot;hands-free&quot;. It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise.

 review/summary: Decent, but a few problems
 review/text: The headset seems to pick up the user's speech fairly well. However, a steady &quot;clicking&quot; sound will sometimes arise which both the user and the person on the other end can hear. I tried to adjust the connection between the headset and the phone, but the noise persisted. It doesn't happen all the time, but does happen fairly often.Another feature that would have been nice but was not included is a button on the wire (as with wireless headsets for other phones) that allows the user to answer and hang up without having to deal with the phone itself.Overall, seems to be the best product available for the Nextel Iden series, but is not a great product.

 review/text: If you only need your clip to last about 3 months then this is for you. Maybe someone who works in an office could wear this clip but it is of no use on a job site. I think the design is poor, being that the working swivel parts are made of plastic, which over time will wear out. I'm searching for an alternative

 review/summary: Flawless
 review/text: Well I was skeptical as hell about buying from a company I've never heard of, for a product that was 1/5th the cost of what I felt was reasonable. I was completely wrong. In spite of being shipped USPS, it showed up the first day of the delivery window. I plugged it in and snapped on the cover (which actually seems marginally sturdier than the original), charged it... And didn't charge it again for a week. *FLAWLESS*. Dirt cheap bargain basement price, and my talk time went from 20 min (with a bluetooth headset) to over 3 hours... This is a massive amount of bang for the buck. No complaints and I'd make the same purchase in a heartbeat.

 review/summary: Extended life cell phone battery
review/text: The battery appears to be exactly what I expected. I purchased 2 batteries, one for my phone and one for my wife. After full charge the battery is good for up to 4 days or more in standby. The price was outstanding (about 25% of what Motorola wanted for the same battery with their name on it, plus the battery came with the required battery cover as the battery is a bit thicker than the original equipment). The only rub was that the shipping charges for the second battery was the same as for the first one even though they came together in the same package. Even with the excessive shipping charge it was still a bargain.

 review/text: Batteries for the e815, 710, etc. leave something to be desired. It's a good deal for the price, but I still don't get as much life as I expected out of this "extended" battery. I've bought three of these, and will probably buy a fourth and fifth, simply because they are so cheap. They do need a way to charge these without being in the phone. All in all, a good deal for the money.

 review/text: This is a great extended life battery. Works great and the price is fantastic. The only thing you should know is that it is thicker than the normal battery and that is why it comes with a new back cover. It adds about a quater of inch to the thickness of the phone. For me this is a good trade off for the longer talk time and is not an issue at all.

 review/summary: Well worth the money
 review/text: I have a Motorola E815 phone approaching 4 years old and the original battery was only lasting about a day. I had heard that a new battery would cost me about the re-up price for a new phone from Verizon. Since my life is quite transitional now, I really didn't know what phone I wanted or needed, hence when I found this battery for less than $10 delivered I thought it was worth the shot. I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected. The battery and the new back still fits within my leather case, and it gives probably four days with moderate use. More usage cuts it down, but I still get a couple of days before it needs to be recharged.

 review/text: Stop fooling around with clipped conversations and embarrassing lost calls. Its so nice not to worry if you have enough juice to finish the call, or sweat the fact that you forgot to charge the phone last night. With this battery it'll wait till tomorrow. Just checked mine after two days off the charger. The phone still shows a fully charged battery. I have never had this battery go dead in use.My only concern was if the larger size would require a larger phone holder. It adds only a 1/8 inch in thickness, if that. The back fits just as well as the OEM, same color and everything. This is an easy decision.

 review/summary: Great way to put off getting a new phone
review/text: Let's face it, unless you want to go iPhone, there's not much exciting about the current cell phone market. I've had my Moto v710 since September 2004. The only problem I was having was battery life. I bought 2 of these replacement batteries because of the price. I figured just in case one is a dud I'll have a second and still it wouldn't be a bad deal. The battery is awesome - longer life than the original battery when it was new. I got it back in May and it's still working great - haven't noticed much decline in its lifespan either. And if it does ever start to lose charge, I still have an unopened one. Do yourself a favor and get 2... you'll be set until a worthwhile phone comes along that is worth the upgrade.

 review/summary: Great Battery
 review/text: Seemed a little light for a battery twice the size of the original but the original never lasted this long. After the first charge it lasted nearly a week. Don't have the ability to test if it's actually 1400 mAh or not, but like I said, it lasts a lot longer than the OEM battery did new. Great deal and comes with a new back cover, I'm quite satisfied, thanks.

 review/text: The battery came fast at a very reasonable price. It lasted only two days new out of the package with out charging. After the first charge it now lasts about four days. At my cottage where cell towers are far apart, the phone requires more energy, it will still last all weekend without charging.I'm happy with the service and the battery.

 review/summary: Small Phone with Big Features and Big Performance
 review/text: First this is a beautiful phone with a beautiful size and a beautiful feature-set targeted for a busy biz type. Features are tri-band for reception, Dictaphone for voice memos, Speakerphone for hands free, and PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar for todo and event alarms with day/wk/mo/yr repeatability on recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take out the trash :), etc.ALL the features work great. Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, and speakerphone, all adjustable. Has a separate power switch on top for quick access to ringer options(one press) or power-off(press and hold)for batt save, etc.It is so small you can wear it in the watch pocket of jeans, in a shirt pocket, or your pants pocket without a bulge. Still, the keypad layout is such that I find it easy to dial because the keys cover the total keyboard, unlike my previous SE T234 small point buttons. For those who derated this phone for its small size, I don't get it? If you want a bigger phone that has bigger keys and a bigger screen, get one for heaven sake. Please rate a phone for its features and performance, not its size. That is a positive for those who want this.Those looking for a well featured small phone with Nokia's quality and RF reception, you will not be disappointed with this one. You will not get a camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, or memory enough for gobs of games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers and video(this is the Nokia 6230i). You will get an excellent and practical communication and organizational device having enough memory for adequate games/ audio/video accessories and the features required for the practical user, and a good price.Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud but adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator and flashing keyboard silent modes, small and VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync with Nokia's free down-loadable SW. Standard barrel-type charger plug.Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, no side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys.

 review/summary: Cool Phone For A Cool Price
 review/text: I've always owned a Nokia phone simply because it works for me(and I'm a creature of habit). =) If you could care less about owning a tricked out, camera flip-phone with all the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you. The one thing that really differs with this phone (compared to the three other Nokias I've had over the years) is that these buttons are really small and it can literally be a pain sometimes when you're sending text messages. After owning this phone for nearly a month now, here's what I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has a useful voice recorder* Speakerphone is very useful (esp. if you're driving and don't own a headset)* You can change your right, navigation button to create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly for those that are cell phone challenged* Comes with a sleek travel size charger* If you're a Cingular customer, this got better reviews compared to the fancy-shmancy (and more expensive) Samsung, LG and Ericcson phones they also offer.Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume has a big difference between levels 2 and 3* If you own a headset for older Nokia phones you have (such as a 3595), it won't work with this one. You'll have to splurge and buy a new headset. =(* Ring tones are kind of weak, I'm 30 and it feels like they had teens in mind when creating ringtones for this phone (same thing with the wallpaper options).* Games are cool, but the bowling game is only limited to +/- 5 games before you're denied access.Hope this was useful for anyone interesed in buying this phone. =)

 review/summary: Great phone, but pretty basic
 review/text: I recently subscribed to a two year Cingular service. At first I purchased a Motorola V551, but that gave me poor reception compared with my Samsung E315, which I previously owned. Not wanting an expensive phone that would drop calls frequently, I decided to trade it in for a Nokia, becasue my father used Nokia ever since he started to use cellular services, and he was extremely satisfied. The Nokia 3120 appealed to me because of it's styling. Although it is not as technologically advanced as the phones I was used to, the styling appealied to me, along with the fact that the phone was 39.99. I truly like the styling. It is the best I've seen in the bar phone class. It is not outlandish in any essence. It is a smart phone for people who want basic functionality. What also appeals to me is the user interface. It is the best one I've seen for any phone. It is the smae interface used on all digital nokias, which date back to about 1996, which is when I first was exposed to Nokias. It is extremely simple to use, the most convinient features can be accessed with two or three button pushes. The biggest thing that got me to purchase this phone is it's reception. Better than any phone i've used. I can use it deep inside buildings. My mother has a Nokia 6010, and she can call from the breakroom in her office, which is in the center of the building. All this packed in a sleek, understated enclosure makes this phone very pleaseing.My only complaints about this phone is the lack of "fun" features, such as a camera or video playback. If you really want a camera phone, but like what you hear abou this Nokia, the 6230 is for you, and I will buy that in 6-12 months. Another thing I do not like is the color. You can get covers for it, but the middle part of the phone, where all the circuitry and the antenna lie, is pasty white, which for a guy like me, is girly. One of my friends commented exactly. One flaw, though it does not bother me, is the size of the phone. While it is higly portable and compact, the buttons could be too small for some.A summary of pros and cons (some i did not list above)ProsStyling and portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize of keypadlack of "fun" features such as camera, although it has a camera attackmentI know this review is very long, but I wanted to cover all aspects of the phone so as not appear bisaed in any direction. I do like the more expensive phones, but that doesn't mean I can't make a logical critique of any phone.

 review/text: A couple months ago, I had a Nokia 3120;however, I wanted to try something new. So I purchased a Motorola v551. At first I was happy I did so, but later I regreted it. So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola. I absolutely love my Nokia 3120. It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great design. I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception. It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.

 review/summary: Decent entry level non-flip phone
 review/text: I've had mine for over a year now, so I thought I'd offer some comments.First, buy a case. This is not a particularly tough phone. My teenage son killed his within six months. Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it. I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone. If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty. I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right. Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness "down." When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling. I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones. Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone. I've looked at others but, for now, have stayed with my little Nokia.

So far, i am very pleased with this phone and it never drops my calls, and my signal is always on full strength. It has good battery life, that lasts up to few days, the interface is intuitive because Nokia's are known for making cellphones simple, and at a great price. Also, the phone came the day before the estimated arrival date. If your'e looking for a good site to buy a good phone, then your'e in the right place(Amazon). ;)

 review/summary: static in reception and speaker interference
review/text: I have been a longtime Nokia supporter, and love that they sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones that pick up great reception. However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker, the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises. This included my car stereo and my speakerphone at work.

review/summary: Tiny phone for tiny hands (i.e. men need not apply)
 review/text: I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC

 review/summary: all of your basic necessities, plus a bit more
 review/text: At first glance I fell in love with the phone - the small design, the chrome plated front, all my friends just love it, thinking its another high-priced, fancy phone from nokia/cingular, when surprisingly it was very affordable, but I must admit - it IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly.It has everything you want and need plus more. It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.

Its somewhat stylish i guess ive seen a couple people with it is a very good basic call phone and texting. other features include internet which is expensive and kinda worthless. The only thing i can complain about is about 9 onths in i was at my computer doing some school work i placed it near the speaker and a friend called it made a reall loud staticy noise (my speakers were up pretty loud so that could of contributed to it)it was actually starteling and made me jump up and turn off the computer. about a weak later i put it on my tv entering my room layed down and another friend called and it did it again not as loud but still pretty annoying. Anyway its not like the world will end but you might get startled once in awhile.

review/text: I needed the charging cord, so this seemed like a a great deal. The case fits fine and the handsfree was a ok, about the same as what came with my phone in the box. It's nice to have a spare, my kids will probably loose mine before long.

review/summary: Very good as 'Phone' (Cheap & works fine)
 review/text: I got new apple 3g .. That was my biggest disappointment. So Returned it and got this phone. This is pretty cheap and almost for free. This phone doesn't have hi-tech functionality like you-tube, bluetooth etc. Internet browsing i didn't try but who cares... you have to keep in mind that this phone is just for basic purpose.Signal quality is excellent. I get bars even every one are having 'no signals', very light weight and very good battery life. What else you are expecting as a 'phone'drawbacks : no bluetooth but getting handsfree wire device is also getting rare because of marketing techniques. Also I miss volume control buttons on side.but overall I am very happy and dropped all plans to buy any other phone

 review/summary: Great phone - unless you are outside or in the car
 review/text: I only needed a basic phone - no MP3, camera, or FM radio. This phone delivered with great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, and a very small size. Inside a building it works great. Why the low score? The tinted plastic over the display makes it impossible to see the display outdoors and in the car. If the sun is out, forget it! I even managed to figure out how to remove all of the wallpaper backgrounds and to maximize the contrast. Still, don't plan to use this outdoors. Nokia should recall this product to replace the tinted cover. Update: Yesterday this phone took was accidently dropped onto a very hard ceramic tile floor and it still works perfectly! A similar drop ended the life of my digital camera a few months ago. So, if I were to rate this cell phone now I would give it 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars. I like reliable, sturdy stuff and this cell seems to be unusually well made.

 review/summary: fairly durable phone
 review/text: I was looking for a durable phone that could take a blow or pressure and keep working. I also did not want random pieces of it falling off when it was struck. I'm a fairly small individual and I also needed a phone that had to be small enough to fit into my pocket comfortably with no protrusions to gouge me. I did not need a camera or any extraneous features like that. This phone seems to be fitting these criteria perfectly. I was planning on spending quite a bit on a phone to meet those criteria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone was free on my plan.I have dropped it a couple of times from about 10-12 feet up onto concrete and it keeps working just fine. It has slid for about 20 feet across a piece of concrete. It does have some minor scuffs after this but nothing significant. It does not have any buttons on the sides so there is nothing there to have fallen off when it hit the concrete. It has been submersed in a water tank and seems to have come back from it well also.As far as visibility of the display issues that other people have mentioned in their reviews, I have noticed that it has what seems to be a "power save" type situation it kicks into where the display is difficult to read. Hitting certain keys seems to kick this "mode" off. Other than those situations I have had no more difficulty reading the display than on other candy bar style phones I have had from Nokia. I have used it in direct sunlight and in various other lighting situations.

 review/summary: A welcome return to simplicity by Nokia
 review/text: Here's how I rate this cellphone:1. Voice quality and reception: +12. Battery life: +13. Fast opening and browsing of menu and sub-menus: 04. Build and keypad spacing: +15. No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5.The other reviewers are right about the screen in sunlight: it sucks. But if you're like me and are chained in a cube for the daylight hours, it doesen't matter that much.The only thing I dislike about this handset, is that it is quite slow in opening its submenus. I would have thought that such a basic, stripped phone would be lightning fast; indeed, it was one of the reasons I bought it, but not so. Gone are the days you could unlock your phone and call a contact within a second.Besides this con, it is solidly built, has exceptional voice quality, and is easy to dial with if you have thick fingers.

 review/summary: No wonder they pay you $150 to take it...read on
 review/text: NOT even an 'entry level' phone as they would have useful basic functions. Entry level should have a screen you can see in the light and a reliable ringer. Display has no brightness adjust only contrast which is useful for making the screen harder to see not improve. Using any wallpaper but white makes the screen impossible to see/read text even indoors in all but a dark room. Fonts have a setting to enlarge (Nokia knew the screen was junk) text but the small display prevents this. Calls have barely audible sound quality to understand the conversation (not due to signal). Buttons are too small for hands larger than medium-sized fingers and don't always make contact first time. Screen back-light doesn't always light when first button is pressed. When backlight is off screensaver time display is impossible to read when activated. Battery time is good most likely due to screen being dimly lit. User settings are all over the place in a unintuitive fashion making personal settings a time consuming chore instead of one menu.I can do w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc. but to fail in the basic functions of a cell phone is pretty bad & not acceptable. No wonder they PAY you $150.00 to take the phone.NO STARS

 review/text: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.

 review/summary: Durable basic phone for those who like to squint
 review/text: This Nokia is about as simple and basic a telephone gets nowadays.You get good sound quality and easy texting in a compact unit.The major drawback is very poor highlighting of menu icon selections.If you have activated many features, this cell will frustrate you.It's a crapshoot what you actually select. I had to buy 2X magnifying specs in order to utilize menu features.Also, the signal strength and battery power indicators can be very difficult to see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) and rapid battery charge rate.The vibration indication for incoming calls is very effective, and ringtones can be adjusted easily.In regards to pricing, AT&T; sometimes will give this cell free for activating two years service. The highest price AT&T; ever charged for this Nokia is $9.99, in refurb condition.I've had my Nokia for half a year, and I appreciate it; it's not perfect, but it is useful. A phone should be a phone, not a portable entertainment system. Thanks to the magnifier specs, I don't have to squint at the screen anymore.

They send it to you for 'free" - lock you into a 2yr contract and then charge you 10x the actual cost of the phone for ETF.

review/summary: Excellent basic level phone
 review/text: As a seventeen year old female, I do tend to use the phone a lot. I got this phone without texting, and I still love it. I have no idea what the other users are talking about with the backlight, mine is always perfectly viewable. Maybe they just need a teenager to work it. ;PThe only problem I have with the phone is that I have a nickel allergy, and the metallic looking finish on the menu and surrounding buttons caused my face to break out with a rash, but as long as I use the easy-to-use speakerphone button, or get a good cover or headset, I should be fine.This phone was easy for even my 60 year old father and computer inept mother to figure out, with minimal help from me. I wish the record function wasn't so scratchy so I could record songs for ringtones, but what do you expect when most people can afford texting and ringtones.I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but as I can't a full five stars for this product!

 review/summary: Slow to ship
 review/text: I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again.

review/text: Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.

Otherwise I like it so far.

 review/text: i got this phone about 3 months ago with cingular. i got one of those "go phones". my previous phone was a tmobile nokia 3595, i decided to go to cingular because tmobile did not have any service at my school. so far im happy with the phone but not cingular, my phone is out of minutes within 2 weeks when it should be 4, on my old phone it was 10 cents per txt message & im, and it was free to recive, cingular is 5 cents to send 5 cents to recive, at first i thought that was ok until i signed onto aim on my phone, i went on my computer and talked to my friends i felt my phone vibrate and it alerted me that i had used 5 cents, these messages kept coming for every message that i had sent on the computer, with my tmobile phone it would foward the ims to my cell but it would not charge me cause i did not use my phone i used my computer. also i had went upstate and i was roaming, since i had a prepaid plan i couldnt make or recive calls, with my tmobile i never roamedPros: downloadable games graphics and ringtones, can do everything a plan can do (prepaid plans), good service,Cons: Expensive, charges you a cent per gigabyte on internet, cant make calls when roaming (prepaid)

 review/summary: Sure to break at some point
 review/text: I purchased two of these phones at a discounted price when I signed up for a Cingular plan. Both phones are already broken and I have only had them for 6 months. My wife's phone had the corner of the phone crack and then break off making it hard to open the face without having the screen slip out of the hing. My phones screen just got a great big blob of color in the middle so I can't read anything on the screen. The phone was great while they worked, light weight, easy to use, good ring and opptions... I'm just not happy that it lasted only 6 months. If you do buy this phone be sure to get insurance since it will probably break at some point.

 review/summary: Small and elegant, but with a few issues
 review/text: This is a simple to use, small, light and generally elegant flip phone, with good reception.Some useful comments for those interested in getting it:-It looks nice and has a fast and responsive user interface (I found the LG interface much better than the Samsung x426). It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.

 review/summary: One person's pro might be another's con
 review/text: Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon. That night, it stopped working. I won't miss it.

 review/summary: First cellphone and IT ROCKS!!!
review/text: The LG C1300 is a sleek, small and very nice cell phone!! Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few "cool" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror. If you are considering in buying a cheap yet great quality design, BUY THIS!!! Oh by the way, Cingular ROCKS!!!!

review/summary: LG C1300 free is still a ripoff
 review/text: First, I hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than "when are you getting home?" "seven." "okay, see you then." because you will spend half your time saying, "wait, can you say that again?" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better. If you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. At least you can keep photos in it.

 review/text: Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better("red") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the "free" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call "Warranty Service" to get the new "red" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is..

Also the volume is *really* bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!

 review/summary: Too many BUGS!
 review/text: I only owned the phone for about two weeks and it was already acting up. First, the hinges became kind of squeaky and just felt horrible to hold the phone. Then, the battery wouldn't even charge. I plugged it into the charger and it looked like it was charging but when I pulled it out, it was still at one bar. And it went down to one bar overnight.. after I had charged it until it was supposedly full. It appears that other people had this problem as I saw people returning the same phone because of these issues.So I highly don't recommend it.

 review/text: I have owned this phone about a month and I've had to take it back to the store 2 times already. The first time the phone "pretended" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking. The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that's about the only thing redeemable about the phone.

 review/summary: THE WORST EVER
 review/text: This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!

 review/summary: Horrible Phone
 review/text: I am actually on my second phone because the other just stopped working. Sometimes it would not allow me to touch certain keys, so I sent it back to Cingular. I thought the problem would be resolved after I got a new phone, but I was wrong. Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work. This Phone is a curse do not get it. My coworker has this phone and she has the same problems. I can't believe I paid $129. on this dam phone.

 review/summary: Don't Buy It!! Warning!! Worst Phone Ever Owned!
review/text: I renewed my 2 year wireless contract for the 2nd time last week and had decided to upgrade my phone. I've had 2 previous Nokia phones free with my plan. I really liked Nokia's performance, but my phone provider does not offer any with a flip phone style. Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience. I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia. I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone. I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well. This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly. Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk. BUYER BE WARE! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!

Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!

Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying. I feel like crushing this phone sometimes. I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls.

 review/summary: Worthless
 review/text: This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.

 review/summary: Not worth it....
 review/text: -I've had this phone for about one year. I've hated it since week one.-It's a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the "upgrade" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don't care about thier customers.

 review/text: This phone is horrible. I live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. People sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. The mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. I think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. DONT BUY IT. Its a waste of money. Find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( I wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. I would give it a -5.

 review/summary: DON'T BUY IT!!!
review/text: This is the worst phone I have ever had. The speaker is terrible. You have to shove it into your ear to hear anything, even after you have turned the volume all the way up. After having it for 3 MONTHS, the screen went blank and I couldn't see anything. Luckily, Cingular sent me a new one. However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery. The buttons on the side are a pain because they will get pushed inside your pocket and make the phone beep and go out of silent mode. Very annoying. So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT!!!

review/summary: Not So Bad After All
 review/text: I got this phone over three years ago. It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, "What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)

 review/text: My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it.

 review/text: This phone is one of the best I've ever had! The design is great as are the controls. You can silence/vibrate it w/o opening it (and vice-versa). I have dropped it onto concrete before and there were no scratches and it still worked fine. I never found any bugs or errors. Service is excellent and I have yet to have any problems with it.However, as others have stated you can't choose shortcuts- they are chosen for you. IM & text messaging are 2 of the chosen ones. Never the less, its still my favorite phone

The C1300 has internet acess, tons of ringtones, and great color display, along with many other features such as a calender, and note pad. This phone will replace a handheld. This phone is also a very ruged phone. i droped this phone in the pool on accident for 10 minutes and it still works. I give this phone a 9.8/10.

 review/text: This is a great Phone! ITs my 3rd phone and i have had problems with 2 of the three. the first one was ugly, and the second one, the battery life was no good. But when i got this LG C1300, it rocked my world! The Battery Life is awesome and the features are real good. You can download ringtones without going online which is really cool and easy. It has a well lit screen and the volume of the ringtones are really loud. The hearing part is awesome, i put it on a volume 3, because when it was on a 5 its like a speaker phone. It only includes one game which is very similar to snake. The picture does not look the same, the big thing in the middle is really a mirror like thing and it flashes green, it does not stay solid. Overall it is a really good phone and i reccommend everyone to go and buy it!

 review/summary: Pretty decent little phone
 review/text: For years, I have resisted the whole cellphone, constantly connected to the world thing. Then, this Christmas, my folks decided to put me on their Cingular family plan and finally force a cellphone on me. At the cellphone store, all I cared about was finding something small, simple, and unobtrusive. This phone seemed like it would fill those requirements perfectly. Well, it has. Both call quality and battery life have seemed more than adequate. I live on the edge of civilization in northwest Colorado where cell towers are few and far between, but I have had what is (to me) suprising success in getting a good signal where one would expect one to be. It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up. If you need a good reliable form of communication and also don't need it to be the center of your life, this model fits the bill.

 review/summary: This phone SUCKS!! Dropped calls left and right
 review/text: My wife got this phone to replace her Samsung X427m that was stolen. I suggested she stick with the Samsung but she wanted something different. She got this phone off of Ebay for $50.Even at $50 this phone is not worth the money. The phone's problem is that the reception absolutely sucks! I am lucky to get 2 bars in my own house using this phone!! Whenever she calls me on my cell or landline phone, the call drops after 5 minutes or so. Its not my cell phone because my SE T637 always has at least 4 bars where ever I go. As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with her and the call dropped for the 3rd time in 10 minutes. I have been trying to call her back, but the call won't go through.This phone reminds me of the nightmares of MetroPCS' pitiful coverage. But the problem here is not Cingular service, its the phone! I can't believe Cingular would allow their name to be branded on this piece of garbage.LG sucks! I will never purchase another LG phone again.I will be getting my wife the Samsung X427m which we had no problems with and NO dropped calls!the only good thing about this phone is the bright screen, but what good is that if the phone doesnt work worth a crap to begin with??NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!

 review/summary: It's below average, but not terrible.
 review/text: It's your basic phone.It calls, it receives, and keeps a phonebook.It has one game, and the basics of calculator, memo, calendar.The graphics/wallpaper isn't that great, but it's just a cheap phone anyway.It has some cheesy ringtones, rather ridiculous actually seeing as how my friends are always laughing whenever they hear my ringtone.It has a vibrate feature, but you can only use the vibrate feature for two levels: when silent & on vibrate, or when on loudest & on vibrate. Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to "flip" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end. In turn, you must scream into the mouthpiece to have the other party hear you. And if you're wondering, it's not the service quality. I tested it with my old Nokia 3595, where I can hear perfectly fine and whisper and have the other party hear me.The battery life has been okay for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've had this phone. Sometimes the battery lasts a long time, but other times, the battery drains for no apparent reason.Regarding signal, I receive about 1/2 the signal on the LG than what I receive on my old Nokia 3595.

I love how small it is and how I can stuff it in a pocket or purse, or even just carry it around in my hand. The ring tones selection is good and the vibration is good as well. Most cell phones I can never use on vibrate, because I simply do not notice when the phone rings. This little sucker will let you know. Not a perfect cell phone, but no where close to being the worst I have ever owned over the last 11 years!

 review/summary: Horrible Reception
 review/text: This phone is the worst and most expensive phone I have ever owned (I got it before it was free). It has horrible reception and it drops calls left and right especially in areas of higher density. The clarity of almost all my calls is incredibly bad. It scrathes very easily. Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones. It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages. Voicemail doesn't work half the time. There's no voice recorder or loud speaker. You can't see the screen in the sunlight. Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying. There's no snooze on the alarm. The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone. The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time). I'm a college student and my phone is my main source of calls and I have to charge this phone almost every day and I have to take the phone charger with me even if I'm gone just for the weekend. I'm very unhappy with this phone. I wouldn't even get an LG again.

 review/summary: Cingular is the problem
 review/text: This phone is not worth the money they charge for it. The voice message never worked right. The volume buttons were on the side of the phone so I was always turning it down to where I couldn't here it on accident. But the worst part is having a contract with cingular. I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual. This phone and cingular are not worth the trouble and expense.

These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back. They have a horrible reputation. I'm glad to read that some people are not having problems with theirs, though.

 review/summary: A Great Little Phone
 review/text: I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim. I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance. So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one. I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton . I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i. I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would. I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem. A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package. I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market. Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot.

 review/summary: Excellent Product, Performs Exactly as Advertised!
 review/text: The Andrew Extensis is a great product! Remove the Baby Bell service from your home or business, then plug this unit into a phone jack with the cellphone in the cradle. From any phone in your home or business, including cordless phones, you can operate exactly like you always have. The benefit?? You now have all of the features, and plan advantages of your cellular phone. It is great for a small business as the owner can take the phone when they leave, or leave it in place and allow the calls to go to voice mail.There is one potential fault. To place the Nokia phone in the cradle, one sets it into the cradle with the phone vertical. After it latches, it gently leans toward the rear of the unit. I accidently broke one I had because to remove the Nokia phone without damage, you must tilt the phone to the front of the cradle before removal.My only other concern with this device...... I wish Andrew had units available for phones other than the Nokia 5100/6100 and Startac. Once these phones are no longer available, what will we do? I can hope!

 review/text: The Andrew Extensis has been a great addition to my home. I run all the phones in my house through the Extensis and have saved $20/month (relative to having both cell and landline service) through using this device. It's reliable and allows me to have extension phones throughout the house rather than carrying a cellphone from room to room. Given the fact that increasing numbers of folks are using cellphones as their principal telephone (see New York Times of August 2003) it's surprising that this item has been discontinued and nobody else seems to have picked up on the concept.

 review/summary: well worth it
 review/text: I use a 2 line cordless phone throughout the house. Line 2 is the cell phone, courtesy of the extensis. Now, I can use my cell phone (via the extensis) throughout the house without losing a call due to poor cellphone reception.The only problem I have is that when I upgrade the phone, I can not get another extensis (since Andrew Corporation has stopped manufacturing these devices).

 review/summary: Great phone...great price.
 review/text: I have not had one single problem with this phone. I can hear people clearly when I make outbound calls and recieve inbound calls. Loaded with features. Reliable phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have had nothing but problems with them. (Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options.

 review/summary: Very good phone with very good service
 review/text: I like the heft and feel of this phone and it comes with every feature I can envision needing other than a speakerphone. The buttons are large enough to avoid accidental presses of adjacent keys. There are three, count 'em, three buttons to take pictures. That is probably overkill. This is my first LG phone and I selected it based on the feature set but also because I've been told and read on the web that the phone handles weak signals well. So far that is true.After a horrible experience with the Motorola 720 which dropped calls faster than fall leaves and an experience with Verizon's highly praised customer service that I wouldn't wish on an enemy, (Let's just say it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Worse than the old Compaq Computer. Worse than Packard Bell (remember them). Worst ever!) I am pleased that so far the L1200 with Cingular service works better in every part of my home and city than the 720 with Verizon.I know service varies from place to place and I am certain there are locations where Verizon is better than Cingular, but here and now I am once again experiencing what I expect from a mobile carrier- a good product and good coverage.

 review/summary: Great phone, not-so-great ringtones
 review/text: Upgraded from the Nokia 3650 because I wanted a camera phone. Picture quality is decent enough considering it's a phone. Reception is great, all the time. I've had this phone for two months and have dropped only one call, early on. The interface is very easy to understand.My only complaint is in regards to the ringtones. The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs. What's worse, you can't record your own and use them, as with many other phones. You have to go to Cingular's site and shell out $2.50 apiece for twenty-second (or less) audio clips.

 review/summary: Even better than I thought
review/text: Everyone in my family has Motorolas (V400, V220, T720) so I was used to those and was skeptical about getting an LG. glad I did! The screen is better than my sisters V400 (it says 128x160 pixles, but looks FAR better) the keys and phone have a good, sturdy feel. The camera is awesome for a camera phone, it looks like a 2 or 3 MP camera!!!! (no, seriously) although there are 3 keys that have to do with the camera...they're not intrusive, but i think its a little overkill. While closed, you can light up the screen, see time OR date, and flip between vibrate and normal sound. VERY conveinient. The screen is bright (inside and out) the sound of ringtones and while talking is awesome. When you turn the ringing volume up its EXTREMELY LOUD, so you never have to wish it were louder. Signal is great. The included ringtones and wallpapers arent the best (there are only 4 wallpapers) but you can get some others online. all in all, GREAT phone!!!

 review/text: I ordered this phone on the net for free with the 2 year Nationwide 450 rollover min Cingular plan. The phone is very well designed, pleasant to manage and small. Also, it is very, very easy to operate. The only thing that I find negative is its reception. I can hardly hear the person at the end of the line. If you use Cingular, you have 30 days to exchange it.

 review/summary: Pretty good, for a while
 review/text: I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?

 review/text: Overall I liked the case, but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily. Within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating. After less then two months, it plastic tab falls out entirely, dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments.It looks like I'll be looking for another case again.

 review/summary: Good case while it lasts
review/text: This case is quite nice and feels great on your hip... but do not expect it to last you the life of the phone. I bought mine around February of 2006 and used it daily until May 2006 when the nub that attaches the case to the belt clip tore out of the leather and would not be reseated. I suppose some a hot glue gun would have made it last a bit longer, but frankly by this point it was looking "used" and was not worth repairing. I do not plan to get another as a replacement. I expect a case - even a cheapo case - to last me longer than 3 months.The best part of this case is the tight fit and the magnetic closure. Both ensure that the Sidekick II will never fall out on its own, even if the case somehow becomes inverted. I once spent the better part of the day with my case pointed open-side down and the flap open, and it was held sturdily in place. The case also protects well against the wet, and the various bumps of life.

review/summary: Business suit for your Sidekick
 review/text: This case is full-grain leather with black elastic sides.It was too snug when I first opened it, but afterI stuffed it with a sweatsock and let it sit for a day,it was fine. The catch does not open accidentallyand the belt clip is very well made and seems very sturdy indeed.This case gives your Kick a rather serious/professional look.It's far more attractive than the workaday case that ships with the Sidekick. So this should be on your list if you are casting about for a pleasing replacement for the original case.

 review/summary: Motorola SLVR L6i Unlocked International
 review/text: The phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one I received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). This international version does not work everywhere I need it to work. I have AT&T service (3G) and it works in NYC, where I work, but it did not work in upstate NY. The network in upstate NY switches from 3G to EDGE. If it had 850 band, it would have worked. The phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. Amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. You might be better off getting a US version instead.

 review/summary: phone was good, service because of the phone....awful
 review/text: I purchased this phone as a replacement for my slvr L2. it has better features...camera,new sleek look,added software. i fully charged it. inserted my sim card, and everything was working fine until i tried to place a call. I found i could place calls but shortly after connecting it would drop the call. so after contacting tech support they said i needed to get a new sim card and it might fix the problem. so i drive 15 mins down the road and get a new sim card just to find out that it doesnt change anything, still having dropped calls. in the end ATT said that it was the phone and it was most likley due to the fact that it was unlocked. ill never buy a unlocked phone again. as far as the phone itsself it worked fine,however im happy that i already had a motorola charger because the one that was sent in the box with the phone was european. i ended up sending it back to mobilecity and only getting a fraction of what i paid for it, due to the dumb restocking fee. so to cut this short, make sure your service provider supports unlocked phones before purchasing!!

 review/summary: The SLVR L6i
 review/text: For use outside the United States especially in Africa, one always needs a quad band unlocked cell phone like this one. I ordered and received two of these from Amazon and shipped them to my folks in Africa. They received them with joy and they jumped into jubilation when they put in their sim card and it started working at once without ant hitch like decoding or anything like that. And they made a call from it to me here in the US. Amazing isn't it? One cousin was even crazy about the ability of the phone to receive the local FM radio transmission in Africa.So then for the L6i to be described as an "International Version", was proved right when my folks got their phone working. However for use in the US please go for the ordinary L6 without the 'i'. Hahahaaaaaa!!!For People traveling outside the US and for those who are here on a short visit if you are looking for gifts for friends and family I strongly recommend this low-priced phone with camera, internet, organizer, SD slot, and FM Radio. I bought some for my friends and they are in use right now. Please buy one or more today.

A one button speakerphone with good sound quality, voice dialing (the good kind which records your voice), the ability to assign individual ring tones to contacts in your phone book, and most beautiful and wonderful and best of all, THE FONT SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 15 YEARS OLD TO READ IT! The clock on the main screen is big and easy to read, and the ring on high is actually loud enough (what a concept!?) The menu and customization features are reasonably comprehensive, and include what you need. In general, this phone is easy to hear, easy to use, easy to see (relative to most others), has clear/clean voice quality, and good reception.The negative?OK, it's not perfect. Reception may not be as good as the very best out there right now. That said, reception and transmission seem as good as most that I've tried, and quite adequate. It isn't tiny. It's about the size of my (lost) LG 6100. It's an inch thick and when the stub antenna is added, 4 inches long. The front screen is difficult to read (Pantech apparently feels that pretty is far more important than functional) and though the front screen is better than most, it could be a lot better (and by that I mean it could be easier to read as opposed to being a color screen with macroscopic font and photo caller ID)What would I change? Well, since it isn't a PDA, camera, GPS, web surfer, Ipod, video game player, it seems like it could be less chunky. An internal antenna, top quality reception/transmission, and a significantly more compact package would be nice. I'd make the front screen high contrast black on white. I like to see an option for black on white display theme (the PN-300 does include a white wallpaper choice ... indicating there is at least one genius at Pantech). A choice for a larger font size and a longer list of ring tones would be useful.Conclusion: I couldn't find any user reviews on this phone, and I was a bit worried that it would be lacking in the features I've used and seen on other current phones. I'm pleasantly surprised with this phone. It is not a stripped down minimalist, make a call only, device. The local Verizon store didn't have the PN-300 and the person I asked about it suggested it was garbage. To that salesperson, who hadn't been shaving long, I'm sure it is. To someone (over 40 crowd?) who doesn't have perfect vision or hearing, and doesn't want their phone to be a tiny personal computer, the PN-300 is an easy to use full featured cell phone, and is easily comparable to most of the current crop of LGs, Motorolas, Samsungs, etc. No, wait ... since the PN-300 does not have all the stuff apparently demanded by the under 30 crowd, it's infinitely better.

 review/text: I got this for my dad and saw him open it and use it for the first time. It's been a few weeks since Christmas and it hasn't broken or anything. It was a bit of a snug fit but the next size up would have been too big. My dad said his old one was fake leather and looked nice but started to fade and fall apart in a short period of time. This one seems more durable.

 review/text: It does exactly what it says. you can browse and save your phone files (pictures, recorded sounds, Bluetooth acquired files) to your PC. You can also update the firmware with "Sony Ericsson Update Service". It can charge your phone but you need a charger connected to the dock for this.Now the bad part, it broke after just weeks of use and I didn't treat it harshly. It's just not working anymore and there's no sign of broken parts. Good while it lasted is all I can say. As with all electric devices, you can have better luck.

review/summary: Great Idea That Did Not Work
 review/text: I bought two of these at Christmas time. The idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. The first problem was that none of the tips would fit my Motorola C261 phone. Then I tried it on a Nokia 2600. Although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when I tried to charge the phone the phone screen said STOP and had a little stop sign on it. So I assume the volts were not correct. The flash lite has two setting and worked great. Returned the items as did not work for me.

I tried to give it to my daughter and it didn't fit her phone either. I never found anyone with a phone it fit to give it to.I just use it as a wind up flashlight now. If anyone finds a source of compatible tips for other model phones that work with this, I would like to know.

 review/text: This case protects the phone from scratches and also comes with a belt clip. It is a very inexpensive case, and it does its job. However, you get what you pay for. If you would like to pay a little more, I would recommend purchasing a krussel leather case. It protects the keys on the phone, and its a little nicer looking. The leather is a little nicer that this plastic case.

 review/summary: This Case Rocks!
 review/text: I purchased this case in an effort to find a case that looked nice but did not draw too much attention to my phone. Also, I wanted it to protect my phone. This case does that. I like that fact that is fits the phone perfectly; like a glove, and does not hinder usage in any way.Another plus it the fact that the case is clear. This, I don't know if it was intentional, allows for the lights to really reflect off of the case when blinking (messages, bluetooth, etc), making the phone visible and giving it a really cool effect with the top of the case glowing in low to no light situations.The case feels nice on the phone and does not hinder putting the phone in your pocket or anything like that.I don't use the clip that came with the case because I am not one who clips my phone on my belt, but if used, it may be a tad uncomfortable as it is pretty big.

 review/summary: good looking but fragile...
 review/text: when i first received this case i was impressed with how clear it was and how sleek. it did not take any beauty away from the phone itself. however, the clip is way too big and bulky - an inch thick and does not hold well at all. for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip. the second day i had the case, it cracked in the center where the thin piece of plastic is located between the screen and trackball - and this happened from me putting my pearl in my center console on its side. then, a couple of days later it cracked again and then the middle piece broke off alltogether. the case protected the phone, since the phone did not get damaged or scratched, but the case itself needs a protector to keep it intact. so, the one star is for the good looking nature of this case but not the protection or lack thereof.

 review/text: I bought this for my blackberry pearl. It snaps right onto the phone wihtout any problems at all...it did get a little tricky when it came to puttint the clip on the back of the phone, You have to use this tacky strip and a screw to put it in this square hole...very odd but we figured it out. the clip allows you to flip the phone to a 360 degree angle, and is easy to remove from wherever you have it clipped from. It was a very good price, it is still in once piece so I would say all in all it is a good deal.

 review/summary: Waste of money
 review/text: After I ordered I received a case that was scratched with a piece snapped off. It looked used. Unfortunately since the piece was snapped the case was unusable.I called the company and they told me they never sent used stuff but would send me a replacement at no charge.The replacement didn't fit the phone... (but just barely--it was the right shape and almost the right size) after 25 minutes of attempting to get the case to fit, I got it on. Then I realized I'd left all these finger prints on the phone trying to get the case on. I wanted to take off the case and clean it but it would not come off.Finally I got it off and it snapped in the process... I tried repairing with superglue but that made part of the case opaque. Ultimately I threw the whole thing in the trash can.This case is a waste of your money. I strongly advise against buying it.

 review/text: This product is certainly durable and it has protected my phone which is what I bought it for. Unfortunately though removing it isn't easy and getting it off hurts a bit. It needs to be removed regularly to get the dust out that collects around the inside of the case from being in your bag or pocket. It would be GREAT if it still fit in a case after putting it on so that you could have the option if you wanted it to.But I'll take durability over a clean phone usually... if I HAVE to.

 review/text: I don't like the plastic belt clip but the clear cover is all I wanted anyway. By the way, you can take the plastic knob off. You just need a really small screw driver (like the kind you use to fix your glasses). The first day I put it on my Pearl, I dropped it. Not even a scratch on the cover. And for an unexpected bonus, the indicator light reflects off the clear plastic to make it easier to see if I have any messages or alerts.

 review/text: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).

 review/summary: easy, simple, but a hassle.
 review/text: i liked it at first, and it provides great protection, but LOTS of dust gets stuck in between the edges of the plastic case and the phone. It gets really unsightly and it's a bit of a hassle to unclip the case to clean out, only to have to do it again after 1 week.

 review/summary: One cent. Why not?
 review/text: For a cent, why not? You pay for it in shipping, but where don't you pay shipping these days? The case fits around the phone. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!

 review/summary: best case
 review/text: I always want to protect my phone, and this case does just that.Pro:If covers majority of the phonethe back is a hard material (probably cardboard)Comes with a clip for your belt (which I have no used)COns:It makes the keyboard much smaller, have to get use to the leather being close to the side of the keyboard.bit of a hassle plugging the phone in.The price.The notification bar is kinda hard to drag down.If you don't mind the cons and want to protect your phone, then I would suggest buying this.EDIT::: Dec 22, 2010Well it has been over a little of three months since I had the case and I am now just noticing wear and tear. The side on the front right have been detached and now I can see the cardboard. The flap that "keeps it in place" is now tearing (just the sides). The front left side is tearing off and that is all I notice.

 review/summary: Almost perfect, minor setbacks.
 review/text: I got this case for my husband about 3 weeks ago and it has worked great! The case has a good bit of padding all around which makes it very protective. We didn't use the clip included because he prefers to have it in his pocket so I don't know how the clip actually works.The only setbacks to this product is that he has to take the case out to charge it on his iphone dock we have because the case is too thick for this, but I'm sure that if you have different accessories it may not be an issue for you. Next setback is the fact that the edges on the front of the case make it a bit hard to reach the keys at the edge when typing.But I am willing to sacrifice a little bit (very little) of easiness in order to avoid accidents!I am definitely recommending this product!

 review/summary: Product was fine...ONCE I FINALLY RECEIVED IT!
review/text: I was incredibly disappointed when I got a message a few days after I made and paid for my order that said "we don't have this item in stock. It could take up to two weeks. If after two weeks we don't ship your order, then may can opt to cancel it." Those aren't the exact words, but it was something to that effect. Also, I had already paid for priority shipping, which I did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. This was one of the three items on my ticket. The other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. The BlackBerry battery that I ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks. While Amazon has been good to me over the years, this was a frustrating and disappointing experience.

 review/summary: Terrible Service!
 review/text: I ordered a battery for a blackberry on October 30th. It didnt arrive by the estimated delivery time, so I emailed, and they asked me to wait until the following Monday. So I did, and still no battery! So I emailed again, and all they told me was that they have no control over the USPS, and would send me a new one. So now, I have to wait another 2.5 weeks to maybe not receive a battery again!Since I received the battery from the seller, I have had email after email demanding I remove this negative feedback from their site. I am NOT going to do this. They have badgered me over and over to remove it or, and I quote, "We've only just begun Steve. If you refuse to act with even a shred of decency or honor, I will make sure you regret it. Remove the negative tonight." This is the very email I received from SellPhoneStop customer service last night. I could be wrong, but why in the world would I remove my honest opinion if I believe I was given poor customer service?? Obviously, they are beginning to threaten me for my opinion. They really DO NOT care about their customers!! I will never, EVER, order from this company again, and I hope anyone who reads this, won't order from then either.

 review/summary: This battery is neither new nor an original BlackBerry product. Plus, it does not hold its charge.
 review/text: I purchased 2 of these. First of all, the product image is wrong, because the image on Amazon clearly shows the BlackBerry logo, and the batteries I got are unmarked and with no logo or mention of the word BlackBerry.I could have gotten over that if the battery actually worked . . .The batteries are refurbished, and not new. (They were not sealed in plastic.) I put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. The next day I unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. By night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. Note that I did not make a single phone call that day. The phone was on Standby, and it died in 14 hours! My old battery was almost as good!Anyway, I bought two of them, as I said. The second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but I can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of ZERO usage (all on standby).As far as I'm concerned, I was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - I was buying an original BlackBerry product (Note: I have complained about the image to Amazon, so I expect they will take action on this soon)2 - I was buying a new batteryI paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. My guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.Well done, Mr & Mrs Fake-Battery-Seller. You got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again.

 review/summary: Better Than Retail
 review/text: Searching the brick and mortar stores yielded little more than frustration. Most places wanted sums more than $30.A few clicks on Amazon revealed a more affordable alternative to being "a slave to retail".I paid a fraction of the cost and it was delivered to my front door.If I HAD to have it at that moment, I would've had to drive 45 minutes out of my way to save $5 over the "manufacturers suggested retail price".Thankfully, I was able to exert a little control over my compulsion and saved 5x that amount. At the cost of a weekend of waiting for the mail.

My options are to buy another phone for $449.00, buy one on Ebay for $130.00, or buy an external charger and spare battery. This choice for less than $20.00 works super. Each night I take the days battery out and replace with the extra. It works great.

 review/text: The battery did not work at all. It had a slight bubble hump on the pack. It was unfortunate because I needed it before a trip I was taking. However, I was able to get another one from the third party that sent it and then returned the bad one back a day before I had to leave.

 review/text: I am not sure if I missed something but I may have been given a used battery. Initially the battery life had a good 2 days of normal usage but yesterday I took my phone off the charger around 5 pm and this morning when I woke up at 6 am it was almost dead. I made one short call and had a few text messages so I am not sure why now after a week and a half of using it that it wont last a full day.

 review/text: Works just like the one that comes with the 8800, 'cause it *is* the one that comes with the 8800. It would be nice if it had a higher power density (which is achievable using current technology) so that the 8800 would last a bit longer between charges. High capacity batteries are available (sadly, not at Amazon) but make the 8800 thicker with the included replacement back shell.

 review/summary: Used Battery
 review/text: I specifically clicked on the "new" battery to purchase. I received the 1st battery and it was dead. Called the company without hesitation they said they would send out another. Waited another 5 days and when the next battery came in it was dead as well! I then thought it must have been the phone - I bought a new phone and took that new battery to test in my old phone. You guessed it - Worked fine! So because these guys sent out 2 bad batteries I ended up buying a new phone. Now I have 2 good phones and 1 good battery. I would recommend NOT buying a battery from this company.

 review/summary: Not OEM product
 review/text: Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured "they couldn't be that bad.")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you.

 review/text: A few other reviewers tried to warn me the same way but I went for it anyway. Contrary to the listing as a NEW battery, this was a used battery that performed the same as the 2 year old battery that came with my Blackberry 8830 World Edition. After 2 years, it holds a charge for about 1 day.Save your money and the hassles. Then go to a chain or big box store and hand over the cash for a (real) new battery.

 review/summary: Battery is not New
 review/text: When I bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. It went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, I could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it. If you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one.

 review/summary: garbage
 review/text: Battery was purchased from OEM Planet. The first battery delivered was clearly used. The contacts showed excessive wear(worse than the original battery that is 3+ years old). The green sticker/label/wrapper was severely damaged and scatched through. Worse yet, the white indicator(for water exposure) had a red strip. I contacted the seller for a replacement, indicating that I wanted a new battery as advertised, and not a used one like they had provided. The replacement battery was delivered promptly. However, it too was used, but not damaged. My experience is very similar to that of other reviewers. $5 buys a used battery, not a new one. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again.

 review/text: I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 3 1/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it.

 review/summary: Does not appear to be a genuine OEM Blackberry battery
 review/text: I purchased this item from WIRELESS UNLIMITED in Texas. Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry, I don't think it is. Why? First of all, my Blackberry is only 4 months old, and its original battery is marked "Made in Japan." While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked "Made in China." Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM. The "made in China" label, the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch, unmarked), and most importantly, the inferior performance, all suggest FRAUD. Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most. I would not trust this seller again.

 review/text: The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far.

 review/summary: An OEM Battery at a Fraction of the OEM Price
 review/text: I bought this battery as a replacement for a weak battery in a Blackberry 8800. It was purchased from the Amazon merchant Webtreo. Delivery was prompt and the battery looks identical to the OEM battery that came with the Blackberry. I have been using the new battery for about three weeks without any problems. This appears to be an OEM battery at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay AT&T for the same battery.

review/summary: Contrarian review
 review/text: I'm gonna be the contrarian amidst the 4- and 5-star reviews. This stand works beautifully in the beginning but over time my Blackberry Curve keeps slipping off. The problem is the fold in the leather that holds the BB up at an angle becomes soft and yield to the weight of the BB and therefore no longer holds it in place. They should have put some kind of stiffener.

 review/summary: Blackberry Leather Desktop Stand
 review/text: First off, I like the stand and would buy it again. Its just not what I initially expected. My expectation from the pictures was this stand was rigid, but its not. When I received the order, I was really confused. It was delivered in a flat mail envelope. I was wondering if they sent me the correct item. After opening the package, the stand was flat and needed to be folded at the creases. Once folded correctly, 2 internal magnets keep the stand from unfolding. The only issue I have is my 8310 doesn't fit as snug in the stand as I would like. But it doesn't fall out. Other than that, the construction and quality are top notch.

 review/summary: Excellent Product for the Money
 review/text: This is a great product for the money, which will allow your BB to sit upright on top of your desk. It uses a magnet inside the leather which, when lined up appropriately, will form the stand. When not in use it will fold flat.

 review/summary: Great little desktop stand
review/text: So I was looking for a stand for my desk at work, I was really tired on laying my BlackBerry down & having it lost in a pile of papers or since I have a "work" setting not knowing who was calling until I picked up the phone. This seemed to fit the bill & the price was right so I went for it. SO glad I did! It's perfect for what I wanted, a simple yet nice stand that keeps my BB upright at a good angle & the best part is that it will hold it while it's in the silicone sleeve! It's made of a nice leather & magnet system so if you need to travel with it, it will hardly take up any room at all, it folds totally flat. It even has "BlackBerry" imprinted across the front, something I hadn't noticed when I ordered it, it's a nice touch. It also has 2 holes in the back flap, I'm guessing it's so you can thread the charging cord through to keep it neat. If you're looking for a subtle phone holder that will look good on probably any desk I'd highly recommend this one.

It's perfect. I can use my phone with out even taking it (very easy) out of the stand. It may have "Blackberry" printed on it, but you have to look real close to see it. For the price, it's just what this Dr. ordered.

 review/text: I am highly satisfied with this product. My original no longer maintains a good charge. I looked for a reasonable replacement and found it here.It fits perfect, charges well, and maintains a very long charge. Upon receiving the battery, I placed in my V555 and charged it, expecting it to take some 15 hours to charge initially. It probably took three to four. After two full days of use (voice and texting), the battery indicator still shows four bars (Full). My original battery would go dead in less than day with use.

review/text: The replacement battery arrived on time but it did not fit easily into my Motorola V557 phone like the original battery does. When I got it in, put the back on the phone, and connected the charger, the phone indicated that it could not charge the battery. I contacted Bargaincell and they offered a refund if I return the battery prepaid. This seems reasonable except that the packaging and shipping cost about as much as the battery (only $1 less). I don't mind paying it once to get the battery but I'm not about to pay it again to return the battery.

review/summary: Very easy to use product
 review/text: I have used my Mustek Bluetooth headset with my laptop for VoIP calls without any problem on the part of the headset. I use Skype for calls, and once my B.T. preferences were configured, the Skype program allowed me to select my headset for both audio input and output. I use it infrequently (15 min. calls every few days) and have not needed to recharge it YET. This may not be standard for everyone but it is a good product to keep around as it is very useful with my calling situation.It is suprisingly light and fits comfortably on the ear with no discomfort after a few minutes use. The user guide is easy to understand and makes set-up very simple.I would recommend this headset without reservation as this product is not a big name in phone gear, but provides very good service for the price. The sound quality is good for all calls, but I have not paired this with a bluetooth cell phone, and have no baseline for quality. With Skype, there is a loss of quality due to Skype's limitations, but I cannot see this having much effect on call quality with a cell phone.

 review/summary: Brighthand Review of Palm Treo 750 / 755p Desktop Cradle (With AC Wall Adapter) , Black
 review/text: Not everything that I do with my mobile device is with the device in between my thumbs. A good amount of time I am in front of a computer but accessing some of the programs on my mobile for a quick reference. It is then that the JAVOedge Cradle for the Treo 680/750 comes in handy.In addition to just propping up the Treo so that I can see when a call comes in, just being able to sync my mobile easily is a lifesaver.The angle of the JAVOedge cradle is good enough to almost be a second working screen. The other thing that makes the cradle nice to work with is just sitting my mobiles off to side but within earshot of an alarm.Of course, the blue light on the cradle is a bit intense, but overall, its a simple and elegant accessory in those times when I am on the go in terms of letting me know my device is being topped of for the next mobile run.And even if you don't ever take this cradle out of your house, it is a better option than just the cables your Treo came with.

 review/summary: Okay except scratches Treo
 review/text: I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy.

review/summary: Nicely designed, but not real leather
 review/text: This case appears to be identical to ones sold by Wireless Emporium and AccessoryOne. It also appears virtually identical to the widely lauded Smart Phone Experts P6 case, although it is not clear to me whether the original P6 case had the snap-down interior flap behind which two SD cards may be stored.First things first. The case that I have (and thus, most likely all of the very similar cases I mentioned) is definitely NOT real leather. I am an analytical chemist, so I used reflection IR spectroscopy to determine that the case (including the material wrapping the clip) is actually a polyurethane-based imitation leather. Having said that, the case looks nice and I wasn't expecting real leather in this price range anyway. [Edit: after three months of daily use the case is now showing significant wear at some of the corners (making it obvious that it is actually imitation leather).]I had several concerns about the functionality of this case, but so far I am very happy with it. Here they are:Concern 1: The magnetic flap might come open too easily if snagged on something. First, the two magnets are pretty strong. Second, the receiving surface is recessed a bit, so the flap doesn't stick out very much. Third (and this was a pleasant surprise), the flap springs back closed by itself, especially while it's on your belt--it is actually difficult to force the case to remain in an open position.Concern 2: My Treo (I have a 700wx) might fall out too easily. The case turns out to be fairly snug, with short elastic strips on the sides. I'm not yet sure, but it looks like the elastic might also have enough give to accomodate egrips. I definitely like having access to my "naked" Treo. Having the Treo get knocked out of the case is still a theoretical risk, but I think I am much more likely to simply drop it. It is fairly easy to retrieve the 700 from the case without bumping anything I don't want to, but I'd bet this is not true for the 680 or any other model without a protruding antenna.Concern 3: The interior snaps might scratch my Treo. The snaps are actually plastic and their faces are quite flat. Whether I insert the phone with the screen facing in or out, I have not yet noticed a problem. [Edit: after three months of use with the phone facing inward most of this time, there is now indeed a scuff just to the left of the speaker that appears to have come from the snap. Despite this, I still prefer to keep the phone facing in.]Concern 4: The magnets might cause data loss. (Actually, this was never a concern of mine, but I have heard others voice it.) No problem to report. I routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields in lab and I have never had a problem. (Credit cards are another story, however....)Concern 5: The magnets might get pressed into the screen and crack it. The front of the case and the flap actually feel like they have fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside, and the magnets themselves are very flat. With the flap closed there are thus several plies of material between the phone and the outside world. No case is bulletproof, but I feel like this one does a more than adequate job of protecting my Treo, without adding any new risks due to poor design.Concern 6: The clip might come off my belt. Not a problem--it's very stiff. So stiff, in fact, that it takes a little practice to easily slide it over your belt. Also, it doesn't scratch my belts like clamp-style belt clips did (although we'll see how long the imitation leather covering the clip holds up....)Concern 7: I might not like a fixed (non-rotating) clip. The funny thing is that the generic box mine came in has a sticker on it saying "Premium Horizontal Fitted Pouch w/ Ratcheting Swivel for Palm TREO 650 700w." Nope--but neither was I expecting one from the product description on this page. It turns out that I wore my prior swivel case in the horizontal position most of the time anyway, and this case sits much closer to my body. It is harder to remove the case completely from my belt (because the clip is so stiff), but this is getting easier with practice.Concern 8: Poor access to connections. You can easily access the headphone jack whether the screen is facing in or out. Either orientation allows access to the volume buttons (after opening the flap) if you want to listen to MP3s. (However, there is no way to conveniently access the 700wx's WMP Play/Pause button, nor to reassign this function to the side button. The best you can do is reassign it to the "Q" or "A" button, which will be just accessible with the phone in the case, at least with the screen facing out.) However, you cannot charge the phone, connect the synch cable, or access the ringer on/off switch while it is in the case.I hope this helps. This is definitely the best case for my needs, and it was inexpensive to boot! Four of five stars.

 review/summary: Durable Case - But Scratches Treo 700
 review/text: I have had this for about 2 months and and love the case and it seems to be holding up to my rough treatment, however about 2 weeks into owning it, I realized there was a scuff mark on my Treo starting to form. It is right near the ear-piece, I thought I may have dropped the phone or something, but over the next few weeks it began to get worse, I finally realized that it lined up perfectly with the snaps that are inside of this case covering small pockets for caring items. After noticing this I began putting the phone in with the screen facing out, and the antenna pointing forward, does not appear to be making a scuff mark on the back of the phone.Overall a well constructed case, but if you are concerned about the appearance of your Treo make sure you put it in with screen facing out.

 review/text: This is a GREAT holster for your Palm or Blackberry product. I use it every day, all day for my Treo 650. Going horizontal is SO much better....and the magnetic clip is easy to use and secure.The original Treo 650 case could be swiveled to horizontal but was difficult to open quickly. The leather also looks much nicer in an executive environment. The price was fair and the delivery was quick.If you carry your palm all the time like I do....in and out of cars......at work and at home.....this is a GREAT case!

 review/summary: Treo phone holster
 review/text: I've had it for a few months now and find that the interior rivets rub a spot on the back of the cell phone. The phone can also be turned on by itself or perform other actions because the holster side of the opening flap has a seam that transcends the key pad buttons, including the hot keys and when sitting in a car the seat belt buckle pushes on the phone case and the seam causes the phone to sometimes turn on and perform some random programs. Dangerous for contact lists etc. I have a few pictures of the inside of the phone case also.Phone can also be propelled out of the case with little force if the correct angle of bump is directed on the antenna while walking. The flap will pop open.I need to get another case.

 review/summary: Was mine the only with very poor craftsmanship?
 review/text: I owned this leather pouch holder for my Treo 650 for a full 2 months before the pouch fell apart completely, rendering it useless. The pouch is two separate components glued: the first part is the pouch itself, and the second part is the belt clip. After being happy with my product for 2 months, it spontaneously (not gradually) came apart where the belt clip is inserted into the pouch. A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there. This is a great, space-saving way to store the phone, and I can't say that other pouches have the same defect, but the specific pouch that I purchased was of very poor quality, and almost resulted in me losing the very sensitive information contained on my Treo.

 review/text: I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great.

 review/summary: Best option around
 review/text: I have tried several models of pouches for my Treo, and this one beats all the others hands down. Other models have serious safety issues for the phone tends to fall out or the clip breaks or loosens. Others are bulky and unconfortable and others are difficult to use with one hand. This model I like because it keeps the phone well protected, it is easy to retrieve it with one hand and to put it back in. It is also well constructed, the leather is both good looking and durable, and the belt clip is very sturdy and durable as well. I have owned all other models, including the hard case, and this is by far the one I prefer. Highly recomended.

 review/summary: basic case
 review/text: This is the basic "attach to your belt" case for a palm treo shaped device.One complaint is that it can come off your belt fairly easily. My palm has not yet broken when this happens, nor has it dropped into water or snow. But the potential is there. So you need to be careful when wearing it.The second complaint is that the case provides no protection for your stylus. My stylus has fell from the palm several times now. So far it fell in my home or office, where I later located it. But eventually it will fall while "out in the world" and that will be it.For the price paid, not bad. But it's nothing special.

 review/summary: Somethings get better with age - this doesn't
 review/text: I owned one of these previously, and was very happy with it. It lasted about eighteen months before the leather around the clip finally began to tear, making the clip's hold on the case tenuous at best. So I gladly bought a replacement.At first glance, the new pouch looks the same. The problem with the clip tearing away from the pouch has been addressed - that part of the case has been reworked and reinforced with a thicker piece of leather - you can now slide the case onto your belt instead of clipping it to your belt.The case seems a little larger that the original - My Treo seems to slide a little from front to back. The interior of the case still has a snapped cover concealing storage compartments for three memory cards. In effect, the case is functionally the same as the original one I had.But you know, I finally figured out why I don't like it. It seems cheaper that the original one. The interior is made out of some kind of fabric and there's a puffy feel to the leather exterior, almost as if the leather is sown on top of a cushion. The original one seems more expensive, more luxurious, by comparison.In short, the case is functional, but its not as good as the original version of this product was. However, ots still better than anything else I've found on the market to date.

 review/text: I bought this for a Treo 650 originally, but now I have upgraded to a Treo 680. I have been using the case for my skinned Treo 680 for at least 4 months. It took a little getting use to pulling my Treo 680 out of the case without a protruding antenna, but I am very use to it now, and couldn't be more happier.I usually clip the case onto my Jean pocket, or a thin leather belt. Both scenarious hold the case in place securely. The magnets are strong, and I have never had either phone fall out of the case.I have had 4 or 5 other case solutions before this one, and this is definitely the Best!

review/summary: More novelty than anything else
 review/text: I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed.Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone.But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week.

My only complaint is with Jabra. It would be nice to have some sort of battery meter on the unit. That way you know when to recharge. For those interested I am using it with a Sony 610.

I tried several calls at different locations, but the performance remained very poor. I really can't recommend this product - I now bought Motrola HS810, and it works PERFECTLY.

 review/summary: Very poor battery life
 review/text: The Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not ready to be utilized in the business enviroment. I have used it for three months with the new Sanyo Multimedia 7400 phone, I found: a VERY SHORT battery life, average reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 10 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive noise in the background when a moderate wind is blowing.

 review/summary: I pretty much hate this product
 review/text: I bought this headset because I used corded earplugs a lot with previous cell phones. But when I bought a new bluetooth cell phone (Sony-Ericsson T610), I bought this because Amazon was offering what sounded like a great deal.Unfortunately, it was a waste of money because I never use the thing. The reasons:1) It doesn't fit my ear (it's too small or maybe just not suited to my ear--it's uncomfortable and always feels like it's going to fall off). The earbud doesn't really get close enough to my ear canal, so even at max volume, the sound is soft, which is OK in a quiet office, but not in a car or outdoors.2) Since it's so uncomfortable, I didn't want to wear it continuously all day long, but if you have the headset linked to the phone, the headset is the ONLY way to answer the cell phone (at least that's how it is with my T610). I had a situation where the phone rang, I hit "answer" on the phone and couldn't hear anything through the phone because I had enabled bluetooth. I had to scramble to find the headset. (Since it's wireless, it's hard to see quickly if headset is connected or not.) Enabling/disabling the bluetooth connection is a multi-step process, so it's hard to do in a hurry (with a corded headset, you can quickly just unplug the thing). So since the choice is between ALWAYS using the headset or NEVER using the headset (since disabling and re-enabling bluetooth is a hassle, and you have to remember whether it's on or off to know how to answer the phone), I've chosen to NEVER use it.3) The buttons on the headset mean you can't see them while you use them. There are two multi-functional buttons that are nearly identical in size and shape. Pushing a button briefly does something different from pushing it in longer. So it's easy to hang up on a person when you really want to just mute them. If you use it all the time, I suppose pushing buttons by feel will become natural and so will remembering how long to push each button to do what you want it to do, but beginners and occasional users will probably make a lot of mistakes, as I did.

 review/summary: Lifetime of unreplacable battery: just beyond 1 yr warranty
 review/text: I got a BT200 (appears to be nearly the same as the BT250) 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement.

 review/summary: well, it's okay.
 review/text: I'll admit that I bought this shape of Bluetooth headset because it wouldn't interfere with my piercings. It synced very well initially with my Sony T616; it only took two tries with the 'simple' instructions, and it doesn't get interference from other people's BT phones around me. My only real complaints are that I wish it would only pick up when I use the button on the headset, not the phone body; and that the sound is a bit muddy, though not terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the T616 and my headphones, but I'd really like a bit more treble. Also, the blue LED can be a bit obnoxious, but that's covered easily with some electrical tape.

 review/summary: Much better than the alternatives
review/text: The Jabra 250 bluetooth has great reception and sync's very well with my Nokia phone. It takes some time to understand the little quirks. I have called customer support 3 times with issues. The problems got fixed each time. The online FAQ page is useless and the company says (online and while you are waiting on the phone for customer support) that email is the quickest option. Jabra says they answer your email within 1-2 hours. That hasn't happened for me yet. The first email never got answered and the second got answered a day later without an response to my actual question.Even the technician on the phone said they have difficulties interpreting email questions. They have very courteous and knowledgable technical assistance reps on the phones.I like the headset. It has good reception, sync's well,comfortable, very long charge(holds longer than my phone, and has easy to press buttons. I still need to solve the constant need to resync the unit but especially for the price this is an excellent headset.

review/summary: excellent bluetooth earpiece...
 review/text: There is on extremely important reason I chose this earpiece "COMFORT". This unit is so comfortable and secure in the ear you forget it is there. I tried a couple of the motorola units and they were not nearly as comfortable. They kept falling off the ear and when I moved my head from side to side they would swing off the ear. This unit sits behind the ear very unobtrusively.As for the functionality this unit is very easy work. The setup is quick and easy. Bur this probably depends on what phone you have. The sound quality is good and the battery life is excellent. Don't waste your money on a cheaper earpiece buy this one.

 review/summary: Great headset and easy paired with the Nokia 6620 !
 review/text: The only reason I gave this tiny instrument a 4* rather than a 5* is because of the easy falling nature of this headset. It does not fit tightly onto the ear but just sits loosely on the ear making you feel that it might fall of any time , but not so the case majority of the times.Other than this I have absolutely nothing to complain about. It paired easily with my 6620. The voice and sound clarity is the best you can find. On one instance the person on the other side of the line did indicate the sound clarity was much better when paired with the headset rather than directly talking on the phone . Astonishing !Also the 6620 does give a indicator showing if the bluetooth headset is attached, so when you do press the answer button on the phone, you can expect your your headset to take control. The answer button is on the top of the headset which is satisfactory taking into consideration that its a wireless headset and given the volume control button, there hardly any place to place the answer button. No complains about that. The battery does drain but not as quickly as some have mentioned in their reviews.Looking at some of the neagtive reviews earlier I was very sceptical on buying this, but this headset has proved itself. It does however eat a lot of battery power of the mobile when talking, but that is common for all bluetooth headsets.Previously I did own a Motorola Headset and this one has just proved its a much better headset than any other there in the market.All in all this is a very good headset for the said price.

The pairing process is fairly simple, there are two versions supplied in the book to allow for different capabilities in various phones. I've never used a Bluetooth headset before this one, so I can't compare to other models, but sound quality and usability seems great.It does take some getting used to in terms of how you put it on your ear, but not overly so. I can definitely recommend this product.

 review/summary: Almost Excellent
 review/text: I've had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied. I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.

 review/text: I've have the BT250 as well as two other Sony Bluetooth headsets (HBH-300 and HBH-600). The in-ear design make for easier hearing, even in loud situations. The profile is also much lower-key, it's still noticeable, but not as obnoxious as others.I charge it every night, alongside my Sony K700i phone, and haven't had a problem with battery life. I use it regularly on my 120-mile roundtrip commute.One warning... I've actually purchase three of these because I broke the first two. The product seems very flexible, but don't try to stretch or pull them too far or you'll damage them. Don't let your two-year old kids do that either.

 review/text: I tried two other Bluetooth headsets before this one. Both of the prior ones didn't fit right, were hard to hear, and provided poor voice quality (despite being made by a major vendor). I was about to give up after multiple trips to BestBuy, and decided to give Amazon a try (since the local BestBuys were out of Jabra products -- and now I see why). The Jabra arrived, and saved the day! It charged right up in its cool cradle, matched with the phone (Treo 650) immediately, and fit beautifully. It's lightweight, you can hear the people you're calling, and you sound great to them. I'm very impressed by the design (fit, form factor, buttons, charger) and utility. What a find!

 review/summary: A good Bluetooth handsfree kit, but with a few problems
review/text: The FreeSpeak is no doubt a reasonably good performer. The sound on it is reasonably clear and the microphone does a good job too. My only complaint on it is that once I paired mine and turn the kit on, my PDA (a Sony Clie PEG-UX50) would no longer be able to connect to the phone (a SonyEricsson T610) via bluetooth unless the kit is switched back off. Could be a flaw with either the phone's design and/or the Bluetooth specification (I never really did test it with a different phone to verify the problem), but since I am able to receive calls while my PDA is connected to the internet (I have GPRS enabled on my line), it would be nice to be able to answer a call without either talking on my phone or taking the PDA offline. Still, a good starter kit if you don't have any other Bluetooth device paired with your phone.Update: Well, I've managed to get a Motorola V600 and tried the same headset on it, and the same problem persists- you can't connect other Bluetooth devices to the phone while the headset is connected. I am now also fairly certain that the problem is with Bluetooth's specifications as I was unable to exchange pictures between the phones while the PDA was accessing one of the phones. So, okay. No fault of the phones, PDA or the headset. Just the way Bluetooth works in general.

review/summary: Possibly the best out there, but one prob with Motorola v551
 review/text: Very comfortable and fits well, very light-weight, good battery life, great sound quality and volume on both ends of the conversation (unless too windy). I only have one complaint when using the BT250 with my Motorola v551 phone: Every time I turn on the headset to establish the [already paired] link with my phone, the phone immediately goes into voice-dialing mode (i.e., "Say name now ... say name louder"). Because I usually don't say anything when it does this, the normal harmless result is "Voice name not found," but a few times my phone somehow matched my silence with one of my recorded voice tags, and I found myself disconnecting a call I didn't want to make in the first place.This did not happen when I used my v551 with a Logitech bluetooth headset (which did not fit me well, causing me not to be able to hear the speaker most of the time).Jabra support first told me to pair the headset to the phone again, this time using the alternate method for phones that support the hands-free profile. This did result in a few enhanced features, but it didn't stop the unwanted voice-dialing. My next email from Jabra support said that this "is normal behavior when you hold the answer/end button on the headset," and they suggested that I either turn voice dialing off on my phone, or use the phone (instead of the headset) to disconnect the link between the two units. Well, there is only one place I can find on the v551 for turning off voice dialing (under the "headset" options), but this doesn't stop the irritating problem. Using the phone to disconnect and re-establish the link is much less convenient. It DOES stop the problem, however, but only if the headset remains turned on (but disconnected) the whole time, adversely affecting battery life. If I disconnect using the phone, then turn the headset off, the voice-dialing thing will happen when I try to re-establish the link, even if I try to do it from the phone just before turning the headset on (which doesn't work anyway).I must say again, in spite of the above, this is truly a great headset. I'm pretty sure (from other reviews) that the problem I have does not affect most phones, and it is primarily just an irritant that I have grown used to, and it only occurs once each time I turn the headset on in order to establish the link.

 review/summary: By far better than I thought
 review/text: My wife wanted one of the new Bluetooth phones, and of course that meant her hands free car kit would no longer work. So the choice was to buy her a cordless hands free headset or another several hundred to install a new car kit. After a protracted review process, I chose the Jabra 250 as it seemed to be the most comfortable to wear and it seemed to have the best volume incoming and outgoing as well from what we looked at on the market, even though it is only using Bluetooth 1.1. Now that we bought it, I'm blown away, this unit is truly amazing. We are using it on the new Moto MPx 220 and it works like a champ. You hardly notice that you are even wearing it, and it has enough incoming volume to blow you away if you don't turn it down. Outgoing volume is good as well. The unit would have received a 5 star rating if it was using Bluetooth 1.2. What I have determined after reading many reviews that were great and those that said the unit was not very good, is that I tend to believe it has to do with the phone it is matched up to. A new high quality phone should work great with this as it does for us. Hope this helps and thanks for all the reviews I was able to read to get me to this point.

 review/summary: Is this thing on?
 review/text: I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810.

 review/summary: Poor reception. Poor range
 review/text: I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS:1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet.2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time.3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out.4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it.5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear.All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating.If you buy this...keep your receipt handy.

 review/summary: Paired with Nokia 6230
 review/text: Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best.

 review/summary: Not bad at all
 review/text: I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while.

 review/summary: It does what it says ...well for the most part.
review/text: I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life. Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge. i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units.

review/summary: Reliable connection to device, improvement over BT200
 review/text: Strengths:This headset connects quickly to the phone, is easy to use, and reception is clear. I had a BT200 before this one. Other than the color difference, I asked what is so different? Upon making my first call with the headset, I immmediately noticed how the transfer of the call from my P900 to the BT250 was almost instantaneous. The reception and clarity of the headset is clear and the connection time is quick. The adjustment time for the user to get used to this device is minimal. Just remember to answer your call by hitting the headset power button quickly. The headset has plenty of charge time to last throughout the day.Weaknesses:One weakness is that you should not use it outside when wind is present. However, this fault is not due to the headset itself. Another weakeness is that the holder of the BT250 needs improvement. I kept the device in my pocket without losing it. Within two days of starting to use the holder with the belt clip, I almost lost the BT250. Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps to locate it outside my car. Use great caution and be aware of your BT250 if you use the holder on your belt. If you sit down, the holder can easily can easily push the BT250 loose from the holder.Summary:With this headset, you can say goodbye to wires forever. Once you have a truly wireless headset, you will not want to go back to wires. The BT250 quickly connects to the phone, is clear and static free, and is relatively simple to use. Other than the holder of this BT250, you will enjoy this headset.

 review/summary: Like the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Very Much
 review/text: I have been using the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 for almost a year now. It is pretty good. The only issue I have with it is sometimes it does not speak well to my cell phone if my phone is in my shirt pocket (left side) and the Jabra is on the right ear.Recently, I lost the ear piece so I purchased the Motorola HS810 to try it out as the Cingular store guy recommended it. I tried using the Motorola HS810 for about one week and found everyone telling me my calls were full of static and that they could not hear me.So I ordered another Jabra BT250 and am again very happy! Wish I could return the Motorola ...Michael Zyda

 review/summary: I quite like mine
 review/text: I purchased my BT250 in the spring in the UK before it was released in the US. I use it with a Nokia 3650.I find the comfort excellent and the range is better than some other reviewers have reported. I once left the in the trunk of my car (VW Jetta) and plugged the headset in anyway. The phone did ring and it sounded fine. On the other hand, I have had breakup when the headset is on one ear and the phone is clipped to the opposite hip.One voice quality, I regularly dial into conference bridges in the UK from the US on my headset while driving. I have no problems being heard.Battery life has been great. I charge mine only a couple of times a month. Mine was advertised with eight days standby time and I turn it off after my commute to work (about 1 hour each way). When I travel I leave the charger at home.I do not use voice tags or voice dialing so cannot comment on this point.

 review/summary: a comfortable and effective workhorse
 review/text: Several years ago I tried an early bluetooth headset that was useless, due to a short battery life. I recently decided to see if the technology had improved, and based on the Amazon reviews, chose the Jabra. The Jabra is a joy to use. I put it in my ear, and often forget it is there. It is great while driving. The sound is loud and clear. In fact, my BlackBerry is sometimes difficult to hear. Tha Jabra solves that problem, with great volume. I have used the thing for hours without ever getting a low battery indication. This is not a gimic. It is a useful and effective tool.

 review/summary: Not for all day communication, big and too obvious on ear
 review/text: No doubt Jabra is the best selling bluetooth headset these days, and for sure it's not the best bluetooth headset on the market, but have to give credit to their marketing department which is doing a good job in promoting this headset. I used to own this Jabra headset, my first impression of this headset is big and it's too obvious on the ear. Amazingly it wasn't heavy and that's good. The headset did a good job in pairing to my phone, it sounded fine, but the range is quite bad, I can't walk to far away from the phone even it said 10 meters range. I was just 2 meters away, the sound quality droped significanly. The battery life was also a problem, have to charge whenever I got a chance. Recently I found a good headset, STEP 1150, which is little known and made by a company called STEP Communications. It got a good review from PC World magazine. (...) It's a small profile headset, all day wearing comfort and long battery life. I highly recommend it.

 review/summary: Way better than expected!
 review/text: I'm one who has always had terrible luck with cellphone headsets. I've owned corded headsets from all major companies, motorola, jabra, plantronics, sony, and I was dissappointed by all of them. I bought this one with very little hope that it would be any better than the others. Boy was I surprised when I fired this baby up and experienced the sound quality this thing offered. I'm also quite pleased with how this thing fits on my ear. I was able to try on the Motorola HS810 at a local BestBuy and I didn't like the way it fit. The Jabra feels much more secure. I also like the large eargel that goes into your ear canal. Excllent!I bought this in December 2004 and it is now March 2005 and I want to say that I still love it! It still works perfectly.

 review/summary: Beam me up - almost !
 review/text: Ounce for ounce - about a fourth of the cost of Gold.But its way2kool and works well. Star Trek like - with a bright flashing blue light behind your ear.I can hear others loud and clear.Others can hear me loud and clear - even if I talk softly (the mike is near your earlobe).Therefore - meets the base requirements. Now for other things -Its easy to lose - since it is so small.It hides behind your ears and almost disappears from view - others may think you are mad and talking to thin air.Batteries "may" be non-replaceable. No mention of this, but I have figured out how the device can be opened (there is one tiny screw) and will come to it when the batteries do die. Batteries seem to last many hours - I haven't tested exactly how long.No warning before batteries die. You can be cut off in the middle of a conversation. Some warning beeps would have been nice.I've paired it in the "enhanced" mode with the sony t610 - works just fine if you bother to read the manual and undertake enhanced pairing. You will get problems others mention if you do regular pairing. There are some glitches but those are on the phone side (I can't hear the beep before I voice dial if I am using the headset). Voice dialling does not work in a noisy environment - but that is not the headsets fault. It works well otherwise. Nothing to complain - all features mentioned work and do so well.The Sony T610 phone has very limited range with this headset. However, this is a phone issue. I also use this with a Linksys USBBT100 adapter and have absolutely no range problems - signal goes through to the furthest corner of all rooms (see my Linksys USBBT100 review).If only it would "beam me up" star trek style.

 review/summary: Great product, not a universal fit
 review/text: The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying "headset signal weak - switch to handset?"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea. It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers. Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water. I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk. If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically. In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket. If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is "connected" (from Activesync's perspective). You will hear a constant "crackling" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn. It took me a while to figure out. You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just "disconnect" the BT session temporarily while talking. This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure. The "hanging" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear. There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help. This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another. Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs. I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes. If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here. I wish I had...

 review/text: I got a BT200 (appears to be nearly the same as the BT250) 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement.

 review/summary: Nice Battery. Bad performance.
 review/text: I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died. Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it. I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge. Shouldn't have. While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle. You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight. Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it? And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it. So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line. On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker. That's about it. Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something. I am trying the Motorola next. This thing is trash.

 review/summary: Disappointing device
 review/text: I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a 15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like 10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons.

 review/text: I owned the 250v for 3 years! and if the piece that held the eargel on hadn't broken I wouldn't be in the market for a new one. This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up.

 review/summary: A Perfect Fit
review/text: I purchased this headset because I was having trouble hearing with the Motorola set I got with my phone. The headset was a snap to set-up, and it is extremely comfortable to wear. My old Motorola set had a tendency to flop around while the Jabra sits comfortably on my ear. Unlike the Motorola, the Jabra's speaker is designed to fit in the ear, which makes it much easier to hear. It comes with two sizes of ear gels, but even with the large gel, I have to lightly press it into my ear during a conversation in order to achieve optimum volume. It's range also seems to be a little limited, but all and all it's a marked improvement over the Motorola headset.

review/summary: Not bad, but....
 review/text: I bought this for my wife a while ago and pairs with her samsung slider phone (can't remember the model number off of the top of my head) quite easily. I've had occassion to use it myself (when I have to use her phone) so I feel that I can confidently rate it.Overall, it isn't too bad for a handsfree. There are times when I call her (even on a land line) and it sounds like she's digitally stuttering. In my opinion; not good. It's realatively light weight and you can wear it for a long period of time without alot of discomfort (she does wear it quite often during the day). The different ear pieces give you the ability to give a custom fit feel to it, which is nice. I've read in some of the other reviews for the bt250v (a similar model) that it has a tendency to fall off if you move your head too quickly; I can see why.Truth be told, I almost purchased one of these for my own cell phone use (I own a Motorola v360) but I read the reviews for the Plantronics Voyager PLT 510. :) I'm glad I did - but that's another review.

 review/summary: Sturdy & Durable
 review/text: The headset is light and fits the ear perfectly. Unfortunately, often people have a hard time hearing me. I can hear them perfectly. I am most impressed with its durability. I forgot it in a pants pocket. The pants went through a wash and dryer. The headset still works albeit with the same problems I mentioned above.

 review/summary: FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great
 review/text: I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the "wired" headset.

 review/summary: Overall Good. Read carefully.
 review/text: Hello,I am a scientist in the field of Microwave/RF circuits and systems. I considered several but finally chose the Jabra A210 along with the BT250 Jabra headset. This review is for both items together.A few things to note:1) swithcing on and off is not very intuitive for the BT250, you have to hold down the power button for "n" number of seconds, the lights will flash in a certain pre-ordained sequence, but if you do hold down the power button more than what is required (this is sketchy), then the appliances enter set up mode, and the pairing between the adapter and the headset might be lost. The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit. So its pairing is not affected by the power button. BUT this set (headset and the adapter) have 8 hours talk time and 240 hours standby time (as per manufacturer's claim), even if it performs up to 80% of the reported claim, you wont have to mess around too much with the power switch. You can comfortably use it during the day and come home at night and recharge the set.2) Quality of sent and received signals. Please note: The jabra A210 has a pin which can be put in to 3 settings. Setting # 1 is for motorola phones, Setting # 3 for all other phones and Setting # 2 is for when you feel discomfort in setting # 1 or # 3. I have a LG VX 6100 NON-BLUETOOTH phone from verizon. I tested the settings extensively by calling a friend. (Thanks Guddu.) I tried setting # 1, there were 2 noticeable problems: (a) My friend complained that the volume of my voice was low, but the clarity was good.(b) I could not use the button on the head set to connect and disconnect calls.But I must mention, I could receive my friend's voice in absolutely loud and clear tones.Both the problems were alleviated when I used setting # 3 on the adapter. In fact, when I started using setting # 3, my friend complained that my voice was too loud! There werent any issues related to clarity.3) Range: The manufacturer claims this to have a range of 10 meters (30 feet). But at the same time, in its manual, it is written that if there are objects in the wireless signal path between the adapter and the headset, the sound quality will suffer.Now we have to consider 2 trade offs for every RF design. (a) power (b) size. We all want the smallest devices with maximum power and range. Well physics and electronics sharply put us back in our places. If you want greater range, you need to put out signal with great field strength. That needs higher battery consumption, high efficiency non linear amplifiers and large antennas. Microstrip patch antennas (generally used for their low profiles and small size) resonate to a particular frequency if their length is correctly defined. But with design modifications, this length can be shortened, but the gain suffers. Also, thanks to the FCC, we have very strict limitations on the frequency bands available (the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave length, and thus smaller the antenna and consequently higher the gain). FCC makes many RF devices work at lower frequencies than we RF engineers would like them to operate at. Also, due to fear of signal from one device interferring with other devices, FCC puts limits on the amount of power a device can put out.Given these considerations, the A210 and BT250 which are required to have excellent power efficiency (8 hours talk time and 240 hours stand by time) and also small and compact size (very small batteries and small antennas) provide a range which is not quite satisfactory. I walked at a radius of 10 feet and even with walls, metal partitions, etc, the signal strength was not that affected. How ever more than 10 feet, the signal had so much noise in it, I had to move closer to the adapter.To be honest with you, I am not happy with the range. I dont think the range is $130 worth (for the adapter and headset = $50 + $80). Period. For a 10 feet range the cost should have been more like $50 (for both).So basically, we have reviewed some basic factors. However, there is one major design flaw that I would like to bring to your attention. That is: The head set and the adapter enter in to stand by mode after one minute of non-usage. So even when you are in the middle of a call and both parties keep silent for more than a minute, the head set and the adapter stop communicating. The call is NOT disconnected. You can either pull the adapter jack out of the cell phone and put it back in, or press the volume key on the cell phone (basically do some thing with the cell phone) and you will be able to resume the conversation on the bluetooth devices. How ever this is not voice operable. Meaning, if the adapter and the headset enter in to stand by mode during the conversation when both parties to the call are silent, even when they both start talking, the adapter and the head set do not start communicating.This is extremely uncomfortable. If I have a blue tooth head set and adapter kit for which I have paid $130 or more, then I want absolute mobility with out any reason to come back to the adpater unless I do so from my own free will.Lastly, here is a recommendation for the people who designed this set. You need to incorporate greater features in to this adapter and head set. It should be able to not only handle voice data but also music and other types of audio information. This means you might need to use a more efficient method of modulation. Maybe you are using FSK which is constant envelope modulation (I deal with military and radar communication, so I dont know what modulation is used for blue tooth), but you cannot include too much information in to the FSK signal. Try using QAM, maybe not a very high order QAM, but some thing capable of handling all audio information. All you will need to change in the design is: a new power amplifier which is high efficiency and linear. Probably a class E or Class F with feed forward or Envelope elimination and restoration (Kahn) or Doherty principles. It is simple. You will need a one time engineering development cost, but in the long term - with market domination and mass production, it will more than make up for it.As for buyers. If you are rich, a techno geek or a business person constantly on the phone - Go for this. It is good.But if you have limited resources (money) then buy a simple wired hands free kit. In fact at times when the battery is down or I have to move to get back within range, I long for the reliability of a wired handsfree kit.Update: June 25th, 2005: By the way, I lost one A210 and recently purchased one more. I tried one more test on it recently. I got a adapter from radio shack (Part # 274-397) which accepts 3/32" submini stereo plug ( as is the plug of the A210) and fits a 1/8" mini stereo jack (as is the plug for all standard head phone jacks). Thus I connected the A210 to the adapter and connected to my new Creative MuVo MP3 player. Then put on my BT250. It worked!! I could hear the music through the blue tooth set up!BUT the music quality was poor... this blue tooth unit probably has enough sampling rate for speech, it is not able to handle the sudden and faster changes in amplitude, phase and frequency of a music signal.Nevertheless it works.Kaushik.

 review/summary: I guess I must be in the minority
 review/text: I've had my 250 for about three months now. While I realize this hardly makes me an expert or a Bluetooth elite, I am not that enthused with this headset.In the first place, the general feeling I get when handling it, is that it is of marginal construction and "quality" was, perhaps, sacrificed to get a unit out on the market.While I will say that it is very comfortable to wear, it fails in one major area - that of "user" volume. I am forever being told that I cannot be heard or that my audio is so low as to be almost a whisper. I didn't buy a headset so I could stand in the corner and yell into my phone; I've seen enough of these "ego heads" doing that in airports and restaurants; talking so loud as though everyone should be interested in their conversation.So I am actively looking again. Maybe the thing to do is just to wait it out and see if SOMEONE can't come up with a headset that is comfortable to wear that actually performs as it says it will.

 review/summary: So far not a big fan.
 review/text: First, I'm totally willing to plead user error (but I don't think so). I bought this item because of CNET's high marks. After successfully pairing it, I found in the manual there were special pairing instructions for my phone (T-610) to get extra features. Since re-pairing it, I no longer get a voice activation prompt and have to guess when to say my contact name.Also, the manual specifies that wireless networks will interfere with Jabra's reception and cause popping. Thank goodness there aren't any of those around! Seriously, these days every Starbucks on the planet has a wireless network up and running.But my biggest gripe is the inoperable voice dialing. I get "no match" after "no match." My guess is that the ambient noise when you record your voice names has to match up with the ambient noise when you make the handsfree call. (i.e. the interior of my car sounds different than my office or living room).Finally, my email to Jabra tech support has gone unanswered (24 hours).I'm still keeping my fingers crossed and will happily edit this review should things work out better. I'm going to try resetting and re-pairing.

 review/summary: Great Addition to my Bluetooth Phone
review/text: I've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for use while driving. It's very comfortable to wear. It has performed extremely well in the car. At times, I've used it at home. The range of the headset is quite good, but I get more static in my apartment. From time to time, I lose connection with my phone. I suspect that it's more a problem with my phone than with the headset...I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I (and perhaps most people) will use the headset. In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset.

review/summary: Lots of static and white noise
 review/text: I thought the Jabra FreeSpeak would be a much better bluetooth headset than a lot of other products on the market. Boy was I wrong! Once I got started with the headset, I heard a lot of static on my end and the people I called could barely hear anything I was saying.Heaven help you if you have an 802.11x setup at home! I have a wireless network at home which seemed to cause a lot of interference with my headset. Even when I tried the headset on the road or elsewhere, the static was unbearable. You could barely keep the headset 1 foot away from your phone before you started hearing static.I returned this puppy back to Best Buy the very next day.I have since purchased the Bluetooth headset from Logitech which works GREAT!!Note: I have a Sprint PPC-6601 phone

 review/summary: Generally happy
 review/text: I have been using this device for two months, and have been generally happy with it - the audio fidelity is good, the unit is comfortable, the battery life is long and, although I haven't tested the maximum range, I usually use it at 10 to 12 feet from the phone (Nokia 6820). My house is in a marginal reception area for Cingular, and using the headset allows me to put the phone in a "sweet spot" with an unusual orientation, giving me three or four bars instead of one.The "belt clip" is a joke.

 review/summary: suck fest!
 review/text: i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!

This one stays put on your ear, it has great volume and it is so easy to hook up. PLUS...it has features that most other headsets don't. Believe me, I am the queen of returns because I am always trying to find a good headset and am always disappointed. I was very pleased with this one! I think Motorola is CRAP!!!! It does not stay put and there is so much static but this one is great! And for those who complain about the wind....you may want to put the headset on the other ear...away from the window! It's only a headset...it is not NASA engineered to wear while swimming, jogging, taking a shower or biking!

 review/text: In general I am okay with this headset, I am using it with a TREO 650 which lends itself to other issues, the headset is not advanced enough to work automatically with the treo. My main complaint is it is not adjustable to my ear. I actually have to use the big ear gel to get it to stay on because the part that goes over your hear is about 1 cm too high over my ear, so the big ear gel holds it up.... It fits my husband perfectly, so maybe it is that I have smaller ears, it just seems to me that there should be a better way to make it fit.

 review/text: If you are one that doesn't sweat for a living or around anything loud, its not bad. Volume could be a bit better but when you begin to have a hard time hearing somebody they are already complaining about the background noise. I have a beard as some I sweat which is death for the mic. I lost two that way. The closest thing I came to for a fix was make a "dog cone" out of electrical tape. When using with the BlackBerry 7520 it disconnects several times a day without indication. In short, if you are a pencil pusher and drive you car with the windows up all the time you will love this headset the fit and feel are wonderful. If you sweat, work around semi noisey stuff, and drive with your windows open save your money. I have also tried the Scala 500 and a few of the Motorola. They all kill the ear and Scala just wasn't loud enough. I am off to try the Plantronics Voyager..

 review/summary: Not all that comfortable and unuseable outdoors
review/text: I have had thins headset for several months now and have to confess I hardly use it. I bought it for my T-Mobile telephone and while pairing was easy, when walking down the street the microphone seems to act like a wind tunnel - wind just blows straight into the microphone and no one can hear me over the combination of street noise and wind.I don't think it is a T-Mobile GSM issue although the microphones on their handsets seem to be so super sensitive that listeners often say they can hear my footsteps and the conversations of others around me better than they can hear me.Overall, not very workable and I'm disappointed. Have actually just ordered a Plantronics M3500 which boasts a noise-canceling microphone. We'll see if there is any improvement.Finally, I thought that at least I'd be able to use this headset for Skpye. It works a charm on my Mac although people say I'm faint, but on my Windows machine I am completely unable to get the sound to come out of the Jabra earpiece; only through the speakers on my computer. While that is better I think than having to listen to a telephone conversation through stereo headphones (which, incidentally, is unbearable and cuts you off from everything going on around you), it is not perfect.

I received this headset as a gift so it did not cost me anything yet I am still disatisfied and will be ordering a different brand. Take my advice, avoid this headset. If not, well, you were warned.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better.

 review/summary: poor quality product!
 review/text: I loved the idea of wireless for the convenience and safety and was loving the Jabra until it fell apart on me. The distance from your headset to the cell was definitely short range, maybe a few feet away before it got fuzzy. What was worse is that after 4 months of owning it, the earpiece (that holds the rubber plug) broke off and the headset surface started fading. The piece breaking off meant I could not put a earplug on there and it was not covered in the warranty (the customer service suggested I super glue it!) I bought another Jabra thinking the last one was a fluke...but other things started falling apart. Very poor quality piece...I would rethink buying this product!

 review/summary: Best BT headset I've ever owned!
 review/text: I bought this headset after having a Nokia HDW-2 headset for about a year, before its battery went south.Did my research, thought this one was the best of the lot.Found out I was nearly right. This is *much* better than the HDW-2. Very little static, doesn't drop calls. Haven't found the limits of the battery (yet), and I've used it in standby mode for nearly 8 hours straight. Works well with the Nokia 3650, including the voice dialing.My talk times are not that long, so I haven't stressed the talk limits yet.As to cons, the only con I've found so far is with fit. The smaller earpiece of those supplied still irritates my ear after a few hours of wearing (on the right ear). Wearing it on the left ear doesn't seem to get as raw, but the piece doesn't fit as well (yes, I've turned the ear-bead the correct way!). However, I take the piece off for a few minutes rest and I'm back in business. Or I move it to the left side for a while.Only other drawback is that I have to turn the Bt250 off before I can use my Bluetooth on my Palm Pilot with the phone. I guess its only one bluetooth device at a time.Charging is easy. Pairing with my Nokia 3650 was a snap.Is it a toy? Yes, like all technology that doesn't keep you alive, its a toy.If you want a wireless headset, I think this is the one for the moment.

 review/text: I have used this headset with my Treo 650 and have been very disapointed with it's performance. It may be a function of the Treo's Bluetooth capabilities so keep that in mind and do not waste your money on this headset if you are using a Treo.It has very poor range; arm's length at best. Outdoors it is useless. It has times when it will refuse to pick up a call. The voice quality is also poor with hissing and crackling. The only place it seems to be remotely useful is in the car where it is within arm's reach and the hissing is only moderate. This is pretty expensive to only be able to use part of the time. Talk time is also much shorter than advertised.My $.02, save your money for something else.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better. Now I have a headset that I can use all the time. I have completely replaced all my wired headsets.

 review/summary: Real handsfree
 review/text: I've actually got the BT200 but thought i'd leave my thoughts here anyway. I've been using this for about 18months now and have generally had no problems. I think bluetooth handsfree kits in general are worth the money over the wired ones as they give you true hands free that works (doesn't fall out of your ear when you turn your head while driving). The Jabra in particular is far better design than any others on the market at the moment because by design its more likely to fit different ear and head shapes. Also the in-ear design means you have the best chance of hearing the other party clearly. And I have never not been able to hear the other person. Setup is easy and takes about 2min. Day to day operation is simple, you just turn it on and it works.There are 2 reasons why I have only give this a 4 star rating.1) Some time it doesn't connect with my T68i after having been out of range (but to be fair I think this is more the crappy T68i than the Jabra)2) When outdoors it isn't very good at cutting out background noise so the person on the other end can't hear me verywell (NOTE: this is ONLY when i'm outdoors. Indoors or in a car while moving is perfect)One of my mates has one too so I know what its like being on the receiving end of a conversation and its fine.

 review/summary: Neat concept, imperfect implementation
 review/text: I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.I second other reviewers regarding poor range. The phone has to be in line of sight, within a few feet. If the phone is in mypant pocket, reception is marginal.Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.When I am voice dialing a phone book entry with multiple numbers,I do not get any audio feedback that the phone is waiting for meto say(e.g) "home" or "work" to select one of the numbers.I find it pratically unusable for voice dialing while driving.I guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the Jabra which seems to beout (see above).Oh by the way, the phone uses battery power at a much faster ratewhen connected to the headset, i.e enabling bluetooth increasespower consumption.

 review/summary: Slick new toy
 review/text: SetupNokia 6820Laptop using Linksys usbbt100 adaptorWith the phone it is a nice handsfree option. In response to the guy that had such a hard time turning the bluetooth connection on and off you can just turn the unit off by holding the button for a few seconds.If your phone supports the more enhanced call management features You probably want to answer the call first since holding it down while the phone is ringing rejects the call. Then while the call is in progress it just places the call on hold and continuing to hold will turn the device off and the phone will revert to standard usage with the call on hold.Additionally many phones, especially those with Bluetooth, have the ability to define user shortcuts to phone features. One setup to minimize the hassel of connecting and disconnecting BT devices would be very handy since the BT menus are normally several menue options deep.Really though this is a headset for someone intrested in constant wear. I highly recommend getting this or any handsfree set to fit your comfort level because if in the end the fit is uncomfy your going to have a pricey doo dad.Range is less than 30 feet but that seems pretty standard for a headset phone combination. Both are trying to maximize battery life and the antennas are not optimally placed. 10 feet is a good rule of thumb unless you have a particuarly bad combination. With the Nokia 6820 I seem to have a comfortable range of about 15 feet. However with the Linksys blue tooth adaptor on my laptop I can walk all over my house and even to my mailbox. Somewhere on the order of 60-100 feet. Very handy if you are a voice chat user or want a quiet discreet source of music without wires at work that dosn't completely obscure your hearing.Also if anyone is wondering the battery is Lithium Ion polymer so there should be no concern over any memory affect if you want to charge up before a full discharge. However the battery is intenal and there does not seem to be any real option for replacement. So you can only expect a life of around 400-500 charge cycles. At once a week that is a good while. At once a day you might as well just call it a year, perhaps less. It will still be working but if you are using it that hard you will also be far more aware of the slow degredation over time.Gave it four instead of 5 for the potential problem of a short usefull life due to the battery and because the fit is not for everyone. Deffinatly something to put your hands on before laying down the money if possible.

 review/summary: Finally, a bluetooth headset that works.
 review/text: I have tried other bluetooth headsets: Plantronics &amp; Nokia HDW-2 but this one beats them all. It has excellent battrey life as advertised and fits in the ear perfectly. I use it while I'm at the gym on the belt even. It comes with spare ear-pieces with different sizes. The sound quality is excellent and loud. It supports advanced headset mode too. A belt clip can be attached to the charger to carry it on your belt. Price is ok too. I use it with Nokia 6600 by the way. It is right ear, left ear switchable.Other bluetooth headsets are wheather weak (the ear-hanger breaks) or have short-life batteries. So look for these factors before buying any headset.

 review/summary: Pretty good product
review/text: I just bought the Jabra BT250 and have only been using it for about a week now. It has a bit of delay when you answer or place a call but it is tolerable. I have always had a very hard time finding earphones that fit me and will stay in my ear (from cell phone earbuds to mp3 players). This fits very securly and comfortably. Easily could forget I have it on. Have only gone about 20 feet from my phone but the phone was in my car with the door closed and I walked to get the mail... I did get a bit of static but perfectly usable. Occasionally I try to place a call and the Jabra doesn't seem to make the connection and I end up using the phone itself. But this has only happened less than 5% of the calls I've made. Easy to put on with one hand...while driving.Overall I'd say good buy only negative that I see so far is the occasional time when I can't get the Jabra to click on and receive the call.

review/summary: Poor belt clip design
 review/text: I don't have much to say about the 250 other than to point out the really poor design of the belt clip/charger. The 250 is supposed to click into this holder (which connects to the power adaptor for charging). This holder is designed to clip onto your belt so that you can carry the 250 when is is not in use. Okay, I agree that you will look extremely nerdy if you have your phone AND your earpiece hanging from your belt but sometimes you need to put the things away and the Freespeak 250 is really too fragile to carry in your pocket. The only problem with this is that the 250 will easily fall out of the holder and if you use it you WILL lose it. It is only a matter of time. My 250 lasted about 45 seconds and when I went to get it from the belt clip it was GONE. Not the holder but the 250 itself. Some lucky stiff at the Houston airport picked it up and walked away.I also thought that the 250 was not well made. When I would push the on/off or volume buttons I could feel the housing "give" a little, as if the buttons were about to collapse into the housing. A little too flimsy and not indication of a long life expectancy for the earpiece.I suggest that you consider another alternative - at $90 the 250 is simply overpriced.

 review/summary: Great headset
 review/text: I have read a lot of reviews for this and the Motorolla headset. While I have never used the Motorolla one I like this one better because no one notices it in my ear. The reception is great, the sound is clear, and no one has complained they couldn't hear me. I have had it for a month with no problems. The only issue I have is when I am near corless phones or wireless networks I have to hold the phone closer to the headset. However when I am at the mall or in the park I do not need to take my phone out of it's case. All in all this is a great headset.

 review/text: Great product... but I bought it for my Treo 650. Jabra makes a different version which looks identical to the BT250 but is designed specifically for use with the Treo 650 and can be purchased at PalmOne's website. DO NOT BUY THE BT250 for the TREO 650. Go to www.palmone.com and buy it there - they are two different devices and the BT250 is severly limited in functionality when paired with the Treo 650.

 review/summary: Handy product for keeping your iPad clean
 review/text: I have used the iPad since the initial launch and absolutely love it. My main gripe has been the need to constantly clean the screen. I initially bought one of the mini stylus to try out and have since ordered a couple more for co workers. The quality is very good and the plug that fits the headphone port is perfect.My only disclaimer is that I use it as a pointer. I'm not trying to do handwriting or drawing on the iPad. It may be fine for those applications but that's not my thing. Like the iPad it is a simple design that just works.

 review/summary: Box wave mini Stylus
 review/text: Purchased this as my fingers are pretty large. Works ok but keep in mind it is small. I have a small lowepro camera case that holds my ipod tuch 4 and its Belkin grip edge case quite handy for active transport and protection with belt velcro loop attatchment (very secure). If I slide my ipod into the case with the stylus connected to the earjack port it fits in no problem. You CANNOT reach the entire ipod screen when this is connected to the earjack. You get most of it but for the area near the top you need to pull it out from the jack port. Somewhat of a hassle.

 review/summary: Box wave mini
 review/text: The product arrived quickly. I ordered this and the box wave Stylus/ink pen. My original review was 4 stars; however, in the last weeks of ownership, I've lost at least 1 black ring from each item! The small black lines you see are actually black really thin and cheap O rings. They make for a comfortable and stylish pen and mini; however, when they fall off and you lose them, it becomes an uncomfortable and ugly Stylus and min! I lost the first one of each before I even noticed the rings move easily! After being aware that I must use caution, I lost another. I'd like them to send me quiet a few spares for each item. But as it is, I can't give this product a good review. I would not order another box wave product knowing about the temporary rings!! It's upsetting!

 review/summary: Good on-the-go stylus, terrific tip, but I don't recommend using it for extended periods
review/text: Length:: 3:02 MinsLike itsbig brother, the Boxwave mini-stylus has a superb tip for today's capacitive touchscreens (older-style, hard styli won't work on them). In winter, when you've got gloves on -- nothing better. Also like the larger model, it attaches to your mobile device with a plug that fits in the 3.5mm audio jack. This little nub stores neatly in a small case with the phone, but its short stature makes it a bit uncomfortable for extended use: finger cramps ahoy! PDApanache and other makers offered telescoping barrels that solved the "almost-gone piece of chalk" syndrome, I'd give a fifth star if this stylus extended in length. But it's still a great tool for keeping your smartphone or tablet screen clean, and is probably more accurate than your finger for "touch typing" an on-screen. For the (current) price, I think it's a quite a bargain.

 review/text: I gave one of these to my father (70) so he could let my sister (35) and mother (67)try it out on their EVO Shift phones from Sprint. About 4 months later he called me up and said he wanted 2 more ordered because he wanted to keep it for himself but both my sister and my mother also wanted it. He said it is helpful for entering information on his phone because his fingers are "large and dry" and sometimes his phone doesn't seem to know he's trying to touch things on the screen. I saw a review about it not working with the Nook Color however my mother uses hers with her Nook Color as well as her phone. She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook. I have one and it works fine on my phone and iPad. The mini size is good for keeping it with us when we are not at home. I keep mine tucked into the case and very seldom use the ear phone port attachment. My mother and sister use the ear phone port attachment to keep it with their phones when their phones are stowed in their purses.

Consider the thickness of your device before buying. This is really a universal stand, so making it fit perfectly is impossible--but realize that not every phone will fit securely.*Where the back of the phone rests is very nice--with a soft felt-like protective material.*The bamboo has some type of laminate which makes it smooth to the touch. I was hoping for more of a raw feeling as the smoothness makes it feel "mass produced".

 review/summary: Great Charger + extra feature
 review/text: Not much to say here other than it charges your phone while in your car. Then here is where this product stands out from other chargers. The cord retracts into the charger body so when it is not being used there is no cord hanging out. Plus you can pull out only the length of the cord you need to charge your phone.

 review/text: This merchant, AccessoryOne, is blatantly lying when they say this battery is "New." I just got my order today and the battery is obviously not new:1. It is not in a sealed package; just loose in a tiny plastic bag.2. The paint is scratched off of the edges.3. There are greasy fingerprints on it.4. The terminals are scratched from the phone it was previously in.If Amazon allows these unethical vendors to hawk their used and/or counterfeit products as new, the whole market place concept they've created is not credibility.

 review/text: I am quite pleased with the product that I only got last week.The reason for this delay is that Amazon, strangely enough, does not deliver to Malta even though we are part of the European Community. It looks as if, since we are a small country, we are discriminated against!!!Anyway I had the item delivered to a friend in the states who in turn posted it to me at home. It got here safely but because of your bureaucracy, late.I therefore limit my purchases to exceptional items only: like this item would have costed 5 times as much in Malta.

 review/summary: Excellent and cheap
 review/text: You get what you pay for, and this headset has been awesome! The white and silver seems to be cheaper priced than the black and silver one (who knows why???), but I think the white one makes the headset less obvious!This headset fits perfectly on my small ears, it clamps on and has an ear piece that sits in your ear to hold it there. There is NO WAY this headset will move! It does not hurt my ear either.It has great reception, but you will have to use the headset in a quiet environment, so no sunroof or windows open. It picks up the external noise and you voice very well. It is perfect for the car, but dont try to use it at the mall or a rock concert.It works with my bluetooth enabled Razor phone. I tried the Motorola headset and it does not work nearly as well as this one, and this one is less expensive!

 review/summary: One of the best low priced headsets available
 review/text: This plantronics is a great headset that is easy to use and provides a pretty good experience overall.*** THE POSITIVE POINTS INCLUDE: ***- Lightweight and fits snugly on the ear. You really do not feel the headset much at all.- Is on the small side so it doesn't make you feel like a telemarketing agent- Controls are excellent and easy to use (basically it is a multifunction joystick that you press to voice-dial/hangup/ or answer, and slide forward or backward for volume up or down.- Provides a flashing light indicator of the remaining charge left when you power on the headset. The light flahses 3 times to indicate full charge, 2 times to indicate 2/3 charge and one time to let you know the battery is nearly depleted. This feature is very rare in this price range and is a big plus point because there is nothing worse than having your headset battery die mid-conversation because you did not know how much charge you had left.- The battery life is excellent compared to other bluetooth headset I have used.- Is very easy to switch from Right to Left ear (Unlike Motorola headsets that require you to snap off the earpiece and re-attach it!)*** THE NEGATIVE POINTS INCLUDE: ***- Not Bluetooth 2.0 compliant so it does not have the extended range or speed.- There is no way to disable the multicolor LED from flashing an alternating blue and red during calls, so the whole world notices you are making a call.- There are no distinctive musical tones to indicate power on or power up (like how the Motorola headsets play crescendo or decrescendo to indicate power up or down)- Does not have the range of some of the other bluetooth 1.2 headset I have used (although it is a difference of just a few feet)- There is a slight degree of static (especially on power up or when you voicedial) but it is not unacceptable nor is it that noticeable during conversations.- My Volume setting seem to be lost whenever I power down the headset.- The charger uses an unusual tip (not a common Mini-USB like other headsets) which means you cannot charge this in the car or from your laptop)Overall you cannot go wrong with this headset. I have owned a variety of headsets including Motorola, Nokia, and even another Plantronics that fits around the ear and I must say that this one is by far the easiest and most comfortable to use.

 review/summary: Great value for a bluetooth
 review/text: I got the black one for Christmas for my girlfriend and now I'm getting the silver one for me. Sound quality is great and fits snugly around the ear. We actually returned a Motorola (HS850?) and got this one because the Motorola hook that went around the ear was a little flimsy so it flopped around a bit too much. This one feels sturdy and the ear piece fits comfortably, partially in the ear. The only reason it doesn't get a 5th star is it's not quite as intuitive as the Motorola's design that has the boom that flips open and close to turn it on/off.

I was very disappointed.Needles to say I was going to keep it after to calling the number on my shipping paper. I opened the package and the bluetooth DID NOT even work!!!!!!!!!! I returned the item and received my money back but I still spent money to send the item back and never got a shipping label from the company when I asked for one. Very displeased.

review/summary: Not the best, not the worst....
 review/text: I'm on my second headset. The first one stopped working after only a couple months. Now this one stopped working also. The customer support was very responsive and I had a new one within a couple weeks. The first headset would not power on. Now this headset will only stay powered on while I'm in a call. I like the fit. Most other headsets I've owned did not fit well and were uncomfortable. This headset fits snugly to my head and the earbud directs the sound into your ear. I found the range is very poor. I have to keep the phone on me and on the same side of my body as the headset or I get static. I was never able to walk freely away from the phone. I have given up on this headset and I'm looking for a better one. Reading other reviews, I don't think my experience is typical for this headset.

 review/summary: DO NOT BUY - WILL NOT LAST
 review/text: I know from experience. I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.See my PALM page at [...]

 review/text: I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged.

review/summary: pretty good
 review/text: i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires. and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40! so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing. the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device. i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why. it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more. so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all.

 review/text: I lost the charger for my Nokia 770 - this is a good substitute. Doesn't always make good contact - after you plug the Nokia into it, it's a good idea to check to see that it is really charging.

 review/summary: Nokia 6126 is a decent phone but poor battery life
 review/text: This review is for an unlocked version of this phone, but with Cingular (or AT&T; nowadays) service. I received this phone from my brother (he used to work for Nokia in Texas) because my other phone broke (nokia 6102i) and my contract with Cingular was for another year (yeah, it sucks).Background: I was not eligible for the upgrade yet, so that meant I had to purchase a phone at retail price (without the contract) which would have run up upwards of $300 and more. So I got this phone (unlocked) as a gift, and the switch-over was relatively easy and trouble-free. I copied my address book from the 6102i onto the SIM card, and when I moved the SIM card to the 6126, the address book was there (taa-daa!). What I was not able to move were the photos I snapped with the old phone. Those I had to send via email, which I saved onto a microSD card and then was able to move to the 6126 (it has a microSD slot, which read the 1Gb card easily).Features: I have always liked Nokia. This phone is no exception (except one which I will discuss later). It is a clam (ie. flip) phone and is almost as slim as (but slightly lighter than) my Motorola RAZR. I like the menu layout of the Nokia. The camera is up to 1.3 Megapixel resolution (settings of 1,024x1,280, 960x1,290, 600x800, 480x640, 240x320, and 120x160). The photos are decent in daylight, but not too great in poorly-lit areas (but that goes for every camera phone I've ever encountered).I like the black and silver coloring. No external antenna (sweet). The button on the side to open it is extra (not necessary). The internal display is nice and large, and colorful. I like the navigation keypad. The textured covering on the rear flap is different (I like it, and is about 50-50 with my friends).There were plenty of hands-free features. There's a speakerphone, which is loud enough to be used outside, Bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files, as well as voice dialing and commands. There is POP3 and IMAP4 e-mail support, audio messaging for sending voicemails directly to another cell phone, and USB cable support (I haven't used this yet).There is a large 1,000-contact phone book has room in each entry for five phone numbers, e-mail and Web addresses, a job title and a company name, work and home street addresses, a birth date, etc. The SIM card can hold an additional 250 names. Other extras include standard stuff: vibrate mode, text and multimedia messaging, calculator, voice recorder, a calendar with reminders, notepad, stopwatch, and an alarm clock.Hands-free features were plentiful, as well. There's full Bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files, plus voice dialing and commands and a speakerphone. For hard-core emailers, there is also POP3 and IMAP4 e-mail support.I tested the quad-band GSM phone in San Francisco/Bay Area using my existing Cingular wireless service. I got the same quality as the old Nokia 6102i phone. Call quality was decent.Now, for the negatives. A minor drawback with the design is that the MicroSD card slot is located behind the battery cover. Although, you don't need to remove the battery itself, but you do need to remove the cover. My other beef is with the battery life. The 6126 has a rated talk time of 3.4 hours and a promised standby time of 10 days. When I maxed out the talk time, I got about 3.5 to 3.75 hours talk-time (impressive). Because I am always on the phone, it is hard to guage the standby time. However, when I paired and activated the Bluetooth, and connected with a Nokia BH-900 earpiece (By the way, the BH-900 earpiece is sub-standard compared to the Motorola HS850, but that is another review altogether) that is when I got a feeling about the battery life in standby. For half a day of minimal use (20 min max), and standby the rest of the day my battery is now at 20-25% capacity. When I turned off Bluetooth, I was able to go a full day with some use and still have over 50% battery capacity. So it seems that when the Bluetooth feature is activated it is eating up more battery juice (which makes sense). I have yet to find a control that tells the phone to automatically turn off Bluetooth when there is no active device around.Conclusion: The Nokia 6126 is a nice phone with many features. I only gate it 4-stars because of the battery life. This is a must, especially for a frequent traveler (like me) or those who use the phone/Bluetooth earpiece a lot. Nokia has to improve on the battery life, and this is easily done with a patch to automatically turn off Bluetooth when there are no Bluetooth devices around.BTW, this phone is still offered from Cingular. I just came from the store

 review/summary: Excellent entry level phone
 review/text: A mistake I notice a lot of people making when reviewing this phone is that they compare it to the phones that boast dual functionality as an MP3 player or camera. Nokia, in my opinion, has always looked for function over form. They throw in certain features as standard, but those features alone are not supposed to be the selling point of the phone. The 6126 is a PHONE first and the rest is an afterthought. With that said let me start the review.PROS:-THIS PHONE IS POWERFUL! I have never experienced any lag with this phone, even when viewing thumbnail photographs or switching between menu items (which you can do WHILE listening to music). My last phone, a sony ericsson z525, was notorious for lagging between menu changes. What really blew me, was that when I load nokia themes to the phone, i could actually preview them when I simply scrolled over it. Anyone who has customized his/her phone with a theme knows how LONG it takes to apply one(albeit a few seconds, but thats an eternity). This phone previews it for you in seconds.-THIS PHONE IS RIDICULOUSLY CUSTOMIZABLE! you can change EVERY aspect of this phone, from how the menu presents itself to how many minutes you want the phone to wait when you hit snooze! For the really intricate stuff it may take a few menu clicks before you find the option, but I have customized my internal displays 1)screen saver (when you first close the phone) 2) Standby screen (10 sec after the phone is closed) 3) Flip screen (what picture the external display shows when you flip open the phone, so when you're holding it up to your ear you can decide what people see). Thats 3 customizations of only the IMAGE of the external display! there are even more options.-ACTIVE STANDBY! This is almost like a start menu on your main screen, it displays any notes you might have entered for the day, the status of the music player, and has a scrolling shortcut bar that, once again, is totally customizable. Oh, and EVERY button on the main screen can be customized as a shortcut - you almost never need to go to the menu screen.-AMAZING SYNCING ABILITIES - I LOVE THIS PART! You will have to download the Nokia PC suite from the Nokia website, but once you do, its complete bliss. Anyone who uses Microsoft outlook will love how quickly and easily the phone syncs over bluetooth. Transfer speeds are quick and there are many customizable options with the software (like whose numbers take priority, outlooks or your phones). The rest of the suite is a little on the cumbersome side since vista allows you to send files directly to the phone by right clicking on the file, which I find more useful.-FLIP FEATURE! Okay, sounds gimmicky. But honestly, i feel super suave. With the flip button you can pull out the phone and have it flipped open and at your ear in one smooth motion. No prying of the thumb or flicking of the wrist, no stumbling. Just smooooooth :-)-MP3 ringtones - send em over bluetooth, you WILL need an MicroSD card for this. Transfer takes seconds. Plays them loud and clear.-Screen - I constantly keep changing my wallpaper just to make use of this bright and beautiful screen, the external screen actually has 262thousand colors, thats how much most phones had on their main screen a few months ago. The internal screen is 16 MILLION colors, its gorgeous. Everything is easy to read, from text messages to web browsing.-FLASH COMPATIBLE!!! A HUGE PLUS - if you know how to use it. Flash lets you have animated wallpaper on both your internal and external screens. I currently have 3 3D rings twirling on my external screen with a clock. Before that I had a picture of a parking space in which the lines actually told the current time, I LOVE flash! And since the ext. screen has so many colors, the animations look beautiful.CONS:BATTERY LIFE - Not necessarily bad at 2 days, but my sony ericsson spoiled me with its ridiculously long lasting battery. Even when the display said it was empty, the battery would run for an additional 8 hours on standby. When the Nokia tells me its about to die, its not lying. Still, I am not disappointed by the battery life, although i have yet to put it through HEAVY usage.LOOKS - I'm a young guy (23) and sorta want a fashionable phone. That said, theres really nothing outstanding about the design of the 6126. Its practical, feels sturdy, has a rubberized outside that helps with grip, no glitz and glam. It is stream-lined and not hard on the eyes. Its simply a hard worker and you sorta have to rely on the screen savers for it to stand out.MP3 player - YES, this was an afterthought. If you want a player thats more integrated, i would go for the 6555, but you lose the flip function and I believe it has a smaller screen. That said, you can still use it to listen to music if you're truly bored, but a lot of people have alternative music players nowadays.CAMERA- Grainy at night, fine in sunlight. Gets the job done if you need it. Nothing special, but then again, this phone doesnt brag that feature but rather considers it a standard for this day and age.CONCLUSION: For the price, I dont think this phone can be beat by any other entry level phone. I was planning on getting the Sony Ericsson, but since its a slider, the keys are small and flat and I have big fingers. Plus I have a camera and music player so I dont see a need for it (although I REALLY wish cingular would bring back the Sony Ericsson K790). Also, I forgot to mention, the phones size and buttons are laid out very well and make it extremely practical to use, another reason I prefer it over the KRZR, which has that useless flushed D-pad that I cant stand. This phone wont turn heads, but it can keep up with you. Especially if your like me and need to jump between menus quickly and get agitated when phones lag behind. Look for its review on youtube so you can see it in action, you'll see what I'm talkin about.UPDATE: Okay, figured out how to extend battery life to almost a week (on standby). If you're like me and too cheap to get the data plan, go to MENU>SETTINGS>CONNECTIVITY>PACKET DATA and turn the Packet Data connection to "when needed". This stops the phone from being constantly connected to the data network and saves a ton of battery life. Also, for the first few days, plug in the phone to charge as much as possible. Li-Ion batteries DO NOT have a memory, they actually benefit from being partially discharged and recharged over and over again. You will definitely notice an increase in battery life after a few days. The battery needs some "warming up time". I hope this helps! I'm a huge advocate for this phone.

 review/summary: Improved in 2007
 review/text: I read reviews before I buy products, and I was a little scared to buy this phone because everyone kept saying the battery life was really bad, the camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" in your pocket, and the sound is really bad (in the headset). Well, after I bought the phone and used it, none of these became a problem. The battery life is fine - those people probably got some of those recalled lithium-ion batteries. Also, when my phone is closed, the keypad automatically locks so my camera button does not take pictures of my packet, or whatever. The headset is a little low, but then if you use the "volume up" button, it gets louder (gee, what a concept). Also, some people have complained about the camera being "grainy." It's a 1.3 megapixel camera phone - which is pretty standard at this time. Some phone have a 2 megapixel or possibly 3 megapixel camera, but they are more expensive (by the way, the less megapixels, the more storage, so I like that I can put more songs on my phone for ringtones).There are the 6131 and 6133 phones available, and they have FM radios, but does anyone even listen to the radio anymore? Also, the phones say what carrier they have on them. This one says Cingular, the 6133 says T-Mobile, and I think the 6131 says Sprint, but the 6131 and 6133 are only available in the UK and shipped from there, so I don't know if they have the same GSM coverage (this is a Quad-Band phone, and the others may be Tri-Band).Long story short, works great, and has clip-on covers avilable so no scratches will occur! Also, if I get bored looking at black, I can change it whenever I feel like =)

 review/summary: OK but has flaws
 review/text: My wife and I recently bought a pair of these phones, based on the recommendation of the sales person at the AT&T; store. The good news is that the connectivity is excellent (at least in the Washington DC metropolitan area).We both use our phones as business-like communication tools, not as personal entertainment devices (we have way better MP3 and digital photography devices). So what we most wanted from this phone is that it be a good phone and I'm not able to comment on its music or picture-taking ability. What I'm not happy with is as follows:1. The voice quality is OK but not nearly as good as our previous LG phones. You will hear some distortion and fuzziness. Not a show-stopper but not great.2. You may as well start by throwing away the manual that comes with the phone - it is totally useless. To use this phone, spend a lot of time walking through all the menus, which the manual will not help you with. The phone really does have excellent options in it, but you will definitely need to discover them yourself.3. If you want to save the phone's contact list to your computer, don't bother with the free Nokia phone manager software. Like the manual, it is basically useless. You get what you pay for, so go to datapilot-dot-com and purchase their Datapilot software and be sure to purchase the bluetooth connector for this phone - Datapilot won't work with the Nokia USB cable but requires their own proprietary connection device (in the case of this phone, the Bluetooth connector, which is way cool). Datapilot is a good product that will allow you to edit the phone's contacts in a rational way. That software plus the Bluetooth connector cost more than the phone does, but it works with most cell phones so you'll be able to transfer the contact list between phones if you need to.4. The phone uses Themes for the background graphic of the screen display. That's fine but if you're not a teenager and so you want a fairly plain, business-like theme, good luck. The phone, as configured for AT&T;, only has one theme. Fortunately, it does have some plain ringer tones which you will ultimately discover by following #2 above.The Nokia is basically a decent phone with a lot of capabilities, and is very inexpensive when purchased with an AT&T; contract. Just be prepared to spend a LOT of time learning how to configure it (and I am a computer systems professional).PS: we haven't had a problem with battery life but we only use our cell phones intermittently and charge them every night.

 review/summary: Horrible Phone
 review/text: I've had this phone for about 5 months, and compared to my previous phone, which was a Motorola V557, the Nokia 6126 is just sad. I'm not even going to go into a full report on this phone, I'm just going to list the pros and cons:PROS:It plays mp3s, has a microSD slot for more space, has bluetooth, the display is very bright and colorful, the size is pretty good - not to small and not ultra slim, and I have never once had a problem with antenna reception (which partly will depend on your service and coverage area).CONS:-Battery life is horrible - one phone call can pretty much drain your battery, and once it starts to go down, it really goes fast.-The connector for a headset is a Nokia pop port, which is not quite as easy to find and can be difficult with non-Nokia brand products.-The button to open the phone is very unnecessary and has caused the phone to open in my pocket several times.-The camera button is on the outside resulting in a couple pictures taken of the inside of my pocket (the way I found to fix this was to turn on automatic keyguard after a minute or two).-When someone is calling, if the camera button is pressed, the phone answers in speakerphone mode - this I just found out today. I had this suspicion for a little while since my mom would sometimes call me and it would cut off after two or three rings and she said it sounded like someone was there but there was no one. Turns out the phone was bumped in my pocket, either by my chapstick or by my hand when I grabbed it, and what she was hearing was the inside of my pocket.-The camera is horrible - really, really horrible. Compared to my previous phone, the pictures are bigger, but they have so much noise. Luckily, I didn't buy the phone for its camera capabilities.-The outer display is pointless. I originally decided on this model over another Nokia because this one had an outer display. I thought it would be neat to assign a picture to friends so when they called, the picture would display on the outside. I never got that feature to work right - the phone seems to take too long to load the picture and I wasn't able to receive calls, or it would ring twice after the image loaded and then the person would have got my voicemail because, on their end, it rang and rang.-I have never found a way to change how the phone lets you know you missed a call, I don't think you can. All it does is flash the outer display every so often (which REALLY drains the battery) and it says "1 missed call". The main screen displays the missed call if you open the phone, but it doesn't make a sound or vibrate to let you know or remind you.-The paint is chipping off the exterior of mine, just like other reviewers said. It has been that way after about one week. This phone just was not designed to carry in your pocket.-The main display screen sometimes gets dirty. It seems to at time collect every piece of lint, dust, and anything else that is in the air. This wouldn't matter if it would have been a flat surface instead of being embedded in the top of the phone. It looks nicer that way, but is not a good idea for something that will maybe be put in a pocket. Again, this is definitely not a pocket-friendly phone.-The sound quality is absolutely pathetic. I have discovered apparently this is a Nokia thing, as my mom's sounds just as bad (she has one of the old Nokia phones). The speakerphone is not too bad, and there are times when you think it may be better to talk over the speakerphone rather then trying to listen through the ear piece. Sound does vary depending on the other person's phone and antenna reception, but, once again, I never had that problem with either of my Motorolas.-There just aren't very many custom features, and there doesn't seem to be enough buttons for a techno-type gadget. Actually, this is basically a phone for people who are not techno-advanced people. It's more like a toy than a phone. I've only ever had Motorola phones, and I didn't realize they had so much more options than other new phones. The main things I miss from my V557 are the option to arrange phone numbers by speed dial number rather than alphabetically, and Motorola's "iTap" text entry. I would have got another Motorola, but I really didn't want the Razor, or any slim phone for that matter. Needless to say, after my contract with AT&T; is up, I'll be switching to a company with better phone options. If you like the features of a Motorola don't ever get a Nokia.EDIT: After I could finally upgrade and got myself a Palm Centro, I gave this Nokia phone to my brother who had broken his ancient Samsung phone. He used the Nokia for a very short time before he decided to use another old phone a friend gave him. He also had pictures of the inside of his pocket, and the phone also would open in his pocket because of the button. He has been waiting forever to be able to upgrade to a phone that allows MP3 ringtones so he could have the "House, MD" theme as his ringtone. Even that feature was not enough for him to continue using this phone, and he is an over-obsessed fan of House (has the same cane, sneakers, etc).

 review/summary: Nice design, but poor battery life, proprietary connections
 review/text: I recently purchased this phone from AT&T; to replace my old, low-end Motorola V180 phone. I am a basic cell phone user; I make maybe 2-300 minutes of calls a month, send a few text messages, and that's about it. This time around, I wanted a phone with a camera and maybe an MP3 player, and the 6126 fit the bill.Pros:- Both screens are excellent. Large, bright, and colorful.- The user interface is good, much better than my old phone. It's more responsive and you can customize more of the phone's behavior. The address book is better designed.- Camera resolution (1.3MP) is higher than other similarly-priced phones.- Call quality is good. It sounds better than my old phone and gets better reception.- Looks and feels nice. With its rubberized exterior and denseness (like an iPod), it feels high-quality. The keypad is raised and has good tactile feedback.Cons:- The battery life is terrible. My old V180 would last a whole week on standby, and it was the cheapest phone you could buy; my 6126 lasts 2-3 days. I fear how bad it's going to be when the battery starts to wear out.- All the wired connections are proprietary, so you won't be able to use your standard USB cables, old wired headsets, or even normal headphones. Sure this phone can play MP3s, but are you really going to carry around a set of Nokia-specific headphones to do that? This part really annoys me, the MP3 player portion is useless IMO and was one of the major reasons I picked this phone. This complaint doesn't apply if you have Bluetooth accessories, though you still can't use the MP3 player (no A2DP profile).- Camera quality is poor. Apparently this is generally true for cell phones.- Speaker volume is low.Overall, I'm ambivalent on this phone. I like the design and features, but the battery life and proprietary connections really annoy me.

 review/summary: Decent phone, but MP3 player add-on isn't worth it
 review/text: I really tried to do my research before I purchased this phone, but unfortunately most of the available reviews were short term users. I was already expecting below-average battery life and a sub par camera, but the benefits I was expecting outweighed these concerns for me. The major problems began to creep in with more use.There are several good points to the phone. It really is a good-looking and well-built phone, and it just "feels right." The sound quality is excellent for both calls and music (assuming you have a stereo headset), and even the Bluetooth headset sound quality is head and shoulders above my old Motorola. The audio player is AAC/M4A capable. The resolution of both LCDs is great. Nokia PC Suite can sync the phone's calendar with Lotus Notes, a rare feature. I appreciate the release button more than I thought I would. I'm sure I'll miss that if my next phone doesn't have it. The only problem with the release button is sometimes accidentally pushing it as you pull out the phone while receiving a call. If the phone is set to automatically answer when it opens, the release gets pushed accidentally, and it's a call you don't want to take at the moment, you're stuck holding the phone closed until it stops ringing. Still a nice feature.Moving on to the phone's problems: One might assume that the combination of Bluetooth and stereo MP3 playback on a phone would imply that the A2DP (stereo) Bluetooth profile is supported. Apparently, one would be wrong. Admittedly, I probably should have assumed no specific mention of A2DP implied that the phone does not support it, but it doesn't help that searching the internet yields mixed results on the issue, and even Nokia tech support still can't tell me one way or the other. As I can't get it to work with an A2DP gateway, it's probably safe to assume at this point that it doesn't support the profile.The rest of the problems stem from the outdated Series 40 operating system and the phone's music functionality. The music player has been tacked on as an afterthought, which has severely overextended the capabilities of the OS. First, the music controls are very cumbersome, using a cursor system to activate on-screen buttons rather than using the phone's keypad for controls. Track numbers may be entered manually in the main player view but not in the playlist view.The phone has apparently not been tested with "large" music libraries. I purchased a 2GB microSD card soon after the phone, ready to load it up with music. However, the music transfer application included with Nokia PC Suite develops problems when trying to read a library of anything over 2000 songs or so. The main issue is that the database of meta tags breaks around that point. Nokia tech support informed me that their test libraries are all around 1000 files or under. However, I'm sure I'm not alone in having a library of around 10,000 tracks or more these days. Fortunately, you can load music files manually through either data transfer mode on the phone, or directly to the card.The problems don't end with the PC software, though. The phone does not organize tracks by subfolders; all tracks within the main music folder and all its subfolders are loaded into one huge playlist. For more specific selection, you either have to use the clumsy folder navigation interface and constantly reselect the main music folder, or you must manually create playlists with the music transfer software, which is time consuming and problematic with the issues I mentioned above. I plan to experiment with generic M3U playlists, but I don't have high hopes. And it gets worse: after filling up my 2GB card and manually creating a playlist for every album, which was 77 in total, attempting to change playlists now completely crashes the phone. It restarts and then reloads the entire library. For now, I'm navigating the huge playlist by guessing at track numbers, although you can only enter three digits. It's almost humorous what happens after track 999: the phone increments the first 9 to 10, so you see track 10 000 (except the last digit is partially cut off). At track 1100, you see 10 100 in the list.It has begun to feel like I'm beta testing the software in this phone, even though I paid for it and signed my life away for another two years to get it. It has crashed more than ten times in the three months I've had it. I especially felt like a beta tester when Nokia tech support had me carry out experiments with my large music library and report back. I'm still hoping for a major firmware update, but I'm not holding my breath. Frankly, they just don't seem that interested in working out the kinks in this mid-market phone with its outdated software components.I'd still recommend this phone if you don't have a large music collection and only want to use the music player very occasionally. If you won't use the music player at all, please buy a cheaper phone that doesn't have it. If you have a large collection and plan to use it regularly, as in my situation, I'd highly recommend spending a little more for something with at least the Series 60 OS, if you buy a Nokia.

 review/summary: marks nokia's entrance into the world of flip phones
review/text: this is an EXCELLENT phone. if you do your research, you will find that compared to the other phones currently offered at att, this one has the least amount of and least pressing quirks or issues.i love everything about this phone. the ease of use, the extensive cusomizations, the high quality sound quality and reception (which are obviously the two most important things in a phone after all... and this one really has the best of both of those things out of all 4 phones ive owned so far.) the bright, stunning screen... its a sleek, stylish, highly functional phone.the caveats of this phone, which are not numerous or severe enough to drop this review to 4 stars, are decent battery life, the 24 mb of memory... and that is honestly all i can think of.

review/summary: Decent phone but the battery is terrible!
 review/text: When I bought this phone, I had read that the battery wasn't the greatest... I guess I figured I'd have to charge it every other day which didn't bother me... But nothing prepared me for how absolutely horrible it really is. If I talk for maybe 20 mins and listen to a couple of songs, this thing is down to nothin! (I had even set the packet data to "when needed" but it didn't help.)It's sad too because it would be a good phone otherwise. The style is cute with a little push button that opens the phone up, which I really liked. The sound of the little stereo speaker is really quite good. The reception is very good. And the format is very customizable (like most Nokias) if only the battery didn't drain like a leaky faucet!I can't recommend this phone and unfortunately I'm going to have to return mine. And since I have read that the 6555 is just as bad as far as the battery life goes, I guess this year will be the first time in about 10 years that I've had to use another brand other than a Nokia. Oh well, I guess it's time for a change!

 review/text: A few words to the wise, Don't buy this phone!!! I got this phone as an upgrade w/ my contract renewal, and was it a mistake! This phone is straight crap! Let's just say, don't EVER, EVER EVER EVER DROP THIS PHONE!I dropped this phone One time and it straight stopped working! I couldn't believe it, so guess what, I dropped it again and figured, I dropped it and it stopped working, lets see if this works.. And Wholla! It started working again. I had an older Nokia, similar to this model. and that phone would take a lickin' and keep on tickin. This thing, is just plastic w/ some lights. How many ways can I say it... GARBAGE!

 review/summary: Battery life is unbeatable bad
 review/text: I did a lot research before i purchased this phone. Upon customers' review, I knew the battery life would be short when i was purchasing. However, I didn't expect to charge my phone everyday. The battery bar went down to 1/4th after I made an hour phone call (the battery was full before i made the call). It's just ridiculous how short the battery life is. Plus, the user manual isn't helpful so much. I followed the maual to set and display the date/year. However, the date/year can only be displayed in internal screen not in external screen. So i need to open the phone to check the date every time, which is not convenient at all. Besides these two cons, Nokia 6126 is an excellent phone to use. The signal/reception is excellent. The speakerphone function works well too. The sound qulity is not bad either. Overall, Nokia 6126 is a good phone to use. Since i got this phone for free from ATT with 2yr agreement, I'm not gonna return it even i'm so dissatisfied with the battery life.

 review/summary: Good idea, not so great execution
 review/text: The phone has many great features and works well most of the time.The battery life, while I didn't expect much, is pretty aweful. Especially compared to previously owned Nokias and my boyfriend's Sony W300i (similiar features and useage runs circles around my Nokia).Three months of use and my internal screen does not turn on when the phone is opened if the phone has been idle. If I activate the external screen before I open the phone, or open and close the phone a couple times, no issues...but for fear of losing the internal screen permanently, I had the phone replaced.AT&T; sent me a remanufactured replacement for a brand new phone. I received it today and it crashed while loading my contacts from my SIM card.For Mac users, this phone is not compatible with iSync, however a plugin can be found on a few websites. I still haven't experienced full compatibility with a couple different plugins.Call quality is good, but antenna placement (it is at bottom) basically gives you one position to hold the phone without disrupting reception.If you plan to use a card reader and SD adapter to transfer files from the MicroSD, be aware ringtones/profiles/ringer IDs programed from data on the card are reset to default. However, picture IDs remain, even if they are images from the card. The card isn't as easily accessible as I'd like it to be, but I had planned on using a card reader to get around the issues with iSync and the cumbersome use of Bluetooth File Exchange, mostly for music. I tried removing and replacing the card while the phone was off, but the phone only recognized the card again if it was on when the card was inserted.Now, this may seem like nit picking, but the internal screen is not flush with the top piece, maybe a better discription is that it's considerably inset, nor is there a protective covering. Dirt, dust and oils collects around the edges of the screen quite quickly and it is nearly impossible to clean. Sounds anal retentive, I know, but it looks pretty gross pretty fast. Resist the urge to wipe it clean - because anything you wipe from the screen ends up in the crack.I've used past phones for an average of two years or more, but somehow I don't see that happening with this phone. I'm pretty disappoined in both companies at this point.

 review/summary: The crapiest phone I ever owned
 review/text: This phone deserves zero rating. Or minus 1. It's that bad. It just turned itself off for no reason, while I was on a very important call with someone whose number I don't have. Battery is half full, but it decided to take a break a guess. I turned it on, and it works fine now.Other problems:- Buttons don't click any more even though they do seem to work; but those that don't "click" any more need tons of pressure to work.- Navigation through menus is cumbersome for some simple things like sending a text message.- Sound is bad as is both reception and transmission. This in a good coverage area. The biggest problem is it cuts off for no reason.- Camera is like a trip back to the earliest digital cameras of early 90s. Picture quality is so bad, you'll wish you never even tried taking those pictures.- I never even use this phone for anything else other then phone calls. I don't really care about the camera, mp3 and so on, so I am dissapointed that even simple things like staying on when battery is full, is a challenge.- Battery life is bad.- Battery indicator is worse. You may leave home with battery half full only to find out that it's getting empty within minutes. And - yes - I do charge my phone fully, and use it until the battery is (almost) empty.- Both my wife and I have the same phone. We use it not more then once to twice a day. Very very light use. Yet both of our phones exibit identical problems. Buttons on her phone got bad even faster then mine - within days of purchasing it.All in all I don't remember when was the last time I was so dissapointed with my purchase. This phone feels like some bootleg black market import, not a real Nokia. However I bought it from AT&T; so it's real.

 review/summary: Has pros but plenty of cons
 review/text: The Nokia 6126 has some very nice features (most of which are also found on newer phones). My gripe is that this phone is incompatible with every PC-to-Phone software program available. The only program which is available is the "Nokia PC Suite" (free at Nokia web site). But that program can't do near what most other Cell-to-PC programs can do.The Nokia Suite for this Phone cannot dedect the contents of the Sim Card, nor the Sim itself. Hence, many features are inaccessible.(Only Phone memory and the add on Miro-chip memory is available.)The contact list editor is the worst ever I've seen. The Contact List should be the core on any phone. If you want to play mp3's - get an mp3 player. The sound quality is severely lacking, and no bass at all.If you want a camera - get a digital camera because clarity will be a world of difference. That leaves us with a Contact List Editor.(1) Cumbersome pop up windows for entries, rather than as all other programs do, which can be edited on one single page and can be printed out. The Nokia 6126 does not have printing, neither does the Nokia 6125 PC Suite. (It will allow you to print 1 Contact per page -- good luck printing 40 pages which would normally fit on 1 page.)There are plenty of sites that only discuss the good points, and I agree it's a nice phone if the core reason for having a phone, contacts and appointment calendar editing & printing wouldn't be so cumbersome or simply unavailable.My last beef is battery life. For my purposes, standby gives me relative sufficient time, but use the phone with PC sync, one better hurry.Charging time runs between 2 1/2 to 3 hours on a home 110V charger.

review/text: I recently bought this phone for 20$ as a GoPhone after losing my Samsung Sync :( I was fully prepared for a phone that was way below the Sync but this phone is on par and better in some areas.Pros:The speaker is amazingly loud-especially compared to the Sync. Voice quality is normal. The cool thing is that you can play music while doing anything else you want!The screen is the same vibrant big screen as the Sync and many newer phones. You can even change the main screen so that it has shortcuts and a calender like a smartphone!Cons:The flip button works great unles you accedentaly block the flip with your finger.The sd card is behind the battery cover. This is not a problem unless you take the card out a lot.Battery life is extremely short but if you charge it every night it should be good.Overall i liked this phone as much as the sync and better in some respects

review/summary: Ugly and it doesn't work.
 review/text: Before owning this phone I had had very good luck with Nokia phones, outside of dropping things on them and jumping into rivers with them in my pocket. I've had this phone just over 4 months and I hate it.I never used any extras or downloaded anything, so this is from the perspective of someone who ordered a phone from AT&T; and made calls and texted and took maybe 5 photos in 4 months:1. It's ugly. No style at all. I'm pretty practical for a twenty-something girl, but I feel like an old woman carrying this thing around.2. That neat-o button that opens it up? That was cool for about a week before the random openings got annoying. The camera button is obnoxious as well, unless you like inner-pocket photos.3. The screen gets filthy and it's so hard to clean out all the corners.4. Reception was not great. I live in the East Bay, CA and I've gotten a steady 2-3 bars at best. My last Nokia got great reception even in the Santa Cruz Mountains.5. Battery life is terrible. I don't talk that much, but I've had to charge it almost every day.6. It started out glitchy and just got worse. I had some problems when it was low on battery or just charged, but they seemed to clear up. Until now. 4 months and it won't stay on. That's unheard of! I'm not going to bother getting it fixed, and I'm not sure I'm going to buy another Nokia phone.

 review/text: This is the worst phone I've ever owned. After several months the paint has begun to chip off. The voice quality is fair at best. The battery life is terrible. Occasionally the mike stops working and the battery needs to be removed to reset the phone. When the phone is powered off, a number of settings (like the default messaging center) disappear and must be re-added.I will be replacing this phone soon and it won't be with another Nokia.

 review/text: I got this phone to replace my beloved Razr. I've had this one now for @ 6 months, and I really like it. The sound quality is excellent, and it is comfortable against my ear for long periods of time, which is a plus. It is also highly customizable, another big plus for me, as well as being very easy to use- it only took @ an hour to set it up how I liked.My only complaint is the battery life, which is lacking. I have to charge it every two, or it dies. This is a little aggravating , but I've learned to just plug it into the charger every night, and no more problems.Overall, a great quality phone!

 review/summary: Nokia 6126 - Good Solid Phone
 review/text: Nokia 6126 - I used the phone for a year now. It is well built and does basic functions well.re: some complaints by others -Pl. note that there is no protruding Antenna in this model...it is embedded inside the phone(below the microphone). So if you clutch your fingers around the bottom of the phone while talking, you may feel call drop/fading.Battery life is comparable with other phones. Make sure Bluetooth is set to OFF when not used. The battery-life indicator is not accurate. The phone charger connector is an easy to use simple round plug, unlike the flimsy multi pin connector in Motorola phones.The camera photos in daytime are amazingly clear. Same with the any wallpapers you download. Understandably, low light photos/ videos aren't great.Bluetooth is perfect. It syncs up with your pc for quick uploads/downloads. I believe one could use it for music as well.Call volume is ok, bot not exceptional. The phone is long, so there's some getting used to for the ideal position for the ear. Note that most cell phone cases have only a tiny opening made for the earphone and if the case slides out during a call, it may feels like call fading. Use a small scissor to cut a slightly larger hole for the ear piece.Outside display shows the clock, which is useful. The camera button is too close to on-off button, not good. There is also a useful voice recording feature. Since I didn't use the phone as a music player, cannot comment.It may not be a trendy phone for the youngsters, but 6126 is a solid WORLD/ quad band phone. Buy a memory card and a case.

 review/summary: Wonderful..on my 3rd one right now
 review/text: I went for 11 months with this phone before it started to crash when I tried to send picture msgs. But if you have AT&T; and you're under warranty, they'll give you the same model brand new FREE. Two months went by and then one night, I clicked the menu button and it froze. So now I'm on my third one BUT I am very happy with this phone.BATTERY - I see quite a few people complain about the short life. Mine has a really long life. And I have the wallpaper and mini screen running the flash solar system which uses a lot of power. I charge my phone I say about every other day. Before when I just used a still picture, I charged my phone every few days. And I talk and text and take A LOT of pictures. I can't tell you how many days is stand by because I can't go that long without my cell haha Either (1) I'm blessed with a good battery or (2) when you first get the phone (or any phone), charge the battery for a really long time a few times (over night about 12 hours about 3 or 4 times) to really maximize the battery [if you charge it for only a few hours, even though it says battery full, it won't hold as much charge].PAINT - Yea, it chips off really easily. But so has any other phone I've owned since my Nokia 5190. Paint is paint and after sitting in a purse or pocket rubbing against keys and coins, the paint does come off. Plus, it's a phone. So long as it works, it's fine by me. Looks shouldn't be a top complaint.SOUND - Excellent quality. I LOVE the speaker phone. I love it so much I didn't bother buying bluetooth. I can hear the other person well and they can hear me just fine. And having the speaker on while it's closed it awesome!CAMERA - Remember, it's only a 1mp. Thus, I did not have high expectations for taking pictures. But I am very impressed with the quality considering it's in the phone. I can zoom in and still the picture is quite nice. You can't compare a cell phone camera with a digicam so of the cell phone cameras I've had/seen/used, this is one of the top 5. With any cell phone, don't buy it and judge it on the quality of the camera. It's a PHONE, not a digicam. As for pictures of the inside of your pocket/purse, keylock your phone before closing it. Or set it up to keylock automatically. Simple solutions to a simple problem.SIGNAL - I find that if my other family members are receiving signal and I am not, if I turn my phone off and on again, I'll get the reception they're receiving. Considering I live in the urban area, cell phone signal is pretty much strong everywhere. But when I do go out to National parks or mountains away from cities, I get decent reception. Not full bars but enough to send msgs and make calls.USER FRIENDLY - I love how every little detail can be changed and adjusted to your mood and desires. I get bored seeing the same things again and again. But with this phone, I can go between a menu from tabs to grids. Colors, fonts, tones EVERYTHING is customizable.PICTURES AND INCOMING CALLS - If the phone is closed, yes the picture you assign to the contact will show up on the outside. I only got this when I got the cell with the updated software. The first one I had (over a year ago) did not have this feature.THE FLIP BUTTON - This is my first flip phone so I would just pull it open when I had it. Then I discovered the button! I love that button. Even after a month of pulling open the phone, it still worked just fine. The button is not necessary for use.MP3 PLAYER - No opinion. I don't use it, sorry.One and only con - The software is glitchy. First phone after 11 months, it would crash when I tried sending a picture msgs. Second phone after 2 months, one random day, it decided that whenever the menu button was pressed, the phone would freeze. I swear it's running on Vista.Yea, I'm on my third one of this phone. BUT I love it. And I love the features and how I can customized it very specifically for me.Remember, if you have AT&T; and you're under warranty and it's still valid, you can get the same phone for FREE. If you're battery life sucks, tell them and they'll give you a new battery for FREE. Software gets glitchy, get a new phone for FREE. In Northern CA, you have to go to a DSC (Device Support Center). Ask the retail store of locations.

 review/summary: I love it
 review/text: I have a 6126, which I use mainly for internet access with AT&T; Media Net (web internet) prepaid service. I LOVE IT. I was able to install Opera Mini (free at operamini.com, just go to it from the phone) into the Games folder. I use this phone mainly for web browsing, and Opera Mini comes pretty close to a normal web browsing experience. I signed up for pay as you go AT&T; which means it took a month before I can sign up for unlimited Media Net. Still, it's been really useful even before that. This is a seriously good web experience for the price.Eventually I may need to upgrade my phone service to get tethering and the phone is capable of that and other things as well that I'm not using yet. So for me this phone will be useful for a long time to come.

 review/summary: Good Phone for the $
 review/text: Had my VX8500 for about a year now, and am pretty satisfied. I bought a 2GB card for it, and use it constantly to listen to MP3s and books. It couples well with my Jabra BT8010s, and has very good sound quality for music and calls.The camera is pretty good too. With the right light, it can take some very nice pictures.The touch controls work very well on mine, and were very easy to get used to.It's even been inadvertantly dunked in a glass of diet pepsi, and still works like a charm (after it dried anyway).Battery life is great, if I don't use the MP3 player, the battery will last about 4 days on a charge (1 or 2 with heavy use).Build quality is pretty good, but I am on a refurb unit now due to the fact that the screen on my first unit blanked out on me (Verizon happily dolled out a new one though).All in all, I'm pretty happy with the VX8500.

 review/summary: Disappointing Phone w/ Short Battery Life
 review/text: I can't think of anything to gush about with this phone. Usually I like Nokia's but have been disappointed in this one.The sound dips up and down while listening to a caller.The moving display on the front screen annoys me to no end and is difficult to read. It is a large screen on the front, yet only 10% of it is utilized. The time and number of missed calls etc moves up and down the screen. Why?My only hope is that perhaps if I feel like reading the manual this can be customized.And the battery....it is CONSTANTLY beeping at me because it needs to be recharged. It is ridiculous how poor the battery life is!Basically, this is just a generic phone to me. I am struggling to find reasons that I like this phone over others. I can't think of a feature that makes it stand out above the rest.

 review/summary: Verizon? Great. Chocolate? Great. Amazon? Not so great.
 review/text: Like the rate plan, like the phone. Don't like the way that Amazon fulfilled the order, however. Evening of day #1: I placed the order. Day #2: Amazon runs a credit check (as all cellphone vendors do) and I'm approved; so my order status is changed from "not yet shipped" to "shipping soon." Later that day, Amazon send me an email to let me know that they've shipped my phones. Status changes from "shipping soon" to "shipped." Day #3: Amazon send me an email, advising me of my new phone numbers. Days #4, #5, #6, #7, #8: Still waiting. Day #9: Phones delivered. OK, so the phones actually arrived during the time period that Amazon said they would. So why am I complaining? Because on Day #3, they had Verizon assign phone numbers and activate the phones. So I had the "privilege" of paying for phone service on days #3-8 without having the phones in my possession. With a family plan of 4 phones, that was about $18, plus taxes and fees, straight from my pocket to Verizon's. Gee Amazon, thanks for the "favor" of activating the phones six days early for me.

 review/summary: Amazing phone, with some minor annoyances
 review/text: Let me start off by saying that this is my 4th cell phone in 5 years, and this by far is the best phone I've ever owned. Phone is so ergonimically correct, and its touch wheel (similiar to that of the ipod) and buttons surrounding the wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly and are amazing. You can set different sensitivity levels for the touch bad and buttons which is awesome. The feature that I enjoy most about this phone is the bluetooth. I purchased a platronics Voyager 510 (works flawlessly up to its advertised 30ft range) along with the phone and the two pieces of hardware are a match made in heaven. You can add a multitude of contact information to each phone number saved in your phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts into a group) and the screen display is top notch as well.Some Cons, the buttons along the side of the phone are a bit hard to press as they are indented into the phone as to prevent them from being pressed by mistake. Would of been nice of LG had put some single, double, triple tick marks on the buttons so that you could at least become familiar with the feel and function of the button. The latch for the charger and for the USB hookup seem a bit flimsy and I believe will ultimately break prematurely.Last thing, i didn't know that VCAST only worked in certain areas. If you're not in verizons ED-VO area of coverage then you cannot use the feature. I'm in Santa Barbara and I get no coverage, checked for other local cities...Ventura, Santa Maria, Thousand oaks and they are not covered either. However, Pasadena and Los Angeles are covered...not sure if that helps anyone but thought I'd through it out their.

If you want to load music onto it you have to buy a mini SD card and a data cable (sold seperatly) If you want to LISTEN to that music, you have to buy special earbuds that only fit this phone. (DUMB)I bought this phone for my 15 year old son. How many pairs of these Nokia specific earbuds am I going to have to buy?????Really a RIP OFF if you ask me....Keep looking! Don't get this one!!!!

 review/summary: How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??
 review/text: The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and "click" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.

 review/text: I bought the V191 unlocked quad band phone because it had the features I wanted, seemed well made and was offered at a reasonable price. It is one of the few phones left on the market without one of those dumb, little built-in cameras. I wanted minimal crap. The phone met my expectations. But the instruction book came in Japanese only. With a bit of help from the store, I found an English translation on line. All is well.

 review/summary: Great Phone ... No Text Messages
 review/text: I think this is a great phone. I bought it to have a GSM phone in Peru and it worked great. Good signal strength. Good sound quality. The battery seems to last forever. For voice, I couldn't be happier with this little phone.However ... I echo the other reviewer's complaint that text messaging does not work. I spent hours in Peru trying to make it work. I returned to the USA and found the English language manual online and looked up text messaging. The manual says it exists, but the relevant menu option never appears on the phone. This wouldn't be so much of a problem for me except, in Peru at least, it is necessary to use text messaging to find out how much money is left on the prepaid SIM card. We had to keep moving the SIM card into our ultra-cheap Peruvian phone to send a text message, which was a pain.

review/summary: OK If You Know What You're Getting
 review/text: I was amazed when this phone arrived with a Hebrew instruction booklet and carried the marque of the Orange cellphone service in Israel. I found an English language version of the instructions online. All I wanted was a telephone, and that is what I got. It does not do anything as sophisticated as texting, let alone take pictures or hook up to the web. But that's all right. It works great as a cellphone. The sound is clear and the buttons are large enough to push without making mistakes. I signed up with T-mobile and use the five faves service with no problem, and with the quad phone I can go overseas and know I can get a local SIM card for temporary use as needed. I recommend this phone as a phone for those who want nothing more, but understand that that's what you're getting, and be prepared to look for English instructions elsewhere.

 review/text: This is an excellent phone, with a long battery life, solidly built. The keypad is one of its best features, the buttons are comfortably arranged and of a good size for text messaging. The internal memory is larger than that of the V3, with 10 MB. It is enough for storing a reasonable amount of ringtones and pictures. It is mp3 capable. You need to buy an external cable and use Motorola Phone Tools though to be able to exchange data between your PC and the V191.

 review/text: It's probably not Amazon's fault... It's the cell phone industry trying to flood the market with stuff that becomes obsolete quickly. Just think of all the different phone chargers you've had to buy over the years. Standardization would be nice for the consumer.The phone I needed a face plate for is several years old. The original picture of the face plate I ordered was exactly what I wanted, but the one I received was a "newer" version.The good news is that Amazon took the product back and returned the money to my credit card.

 review/summary: Does not support treo 755p UNLESS you use the adapter and purchase a stereo adapter plug
 review/text: The literature leads you to believe it works with the treo 755p. NOT UNLESS you use the bluetooth adapter. It seems to connect since both phone and the earphones indicate connected but it does not respond when music is played. To make it work you have to use the blue tooth adapter (which you shouldn't have to do since the phone is bluetooth). In addition, the stereo jack with the adapter does not fit in the small earplug jack outlet in the phone. You have to purchase a jack adapter also. Very disappointing.

review/text: I own several Platronics Headsets (DSP400 / DSP500) to talk on Skype and I own a Macbook.I bough this headset to use with Skype, so I don't need to be wired to the computer while talking (since I talk a lot on Skype). I tried them with MacOSX 10.4.x (Tiger) and now with 10.5.x (Leopard) since I read the quality of bluetooth headsets would be better on Leopard.Since I own several plantronics headsets I was expecting a good quality. I have to confess that I hate the quality. The sound quality is bad and lagged. It drives me nuts to talk for a long time with them because of the lag and because I have to repeat myself several times (because the other person doesn't understand properly).

 review/text: With the exception of the (annoying) flashing blue light on the outside of the right ear piece, this bluetooth headset outperforms others I have tried. As with most bluetooth devices, it is subject to momentary signal loss of (3 sec) durations. The sound quality is good when compared with my hard wired Bose QC3 set (w/o noise compensation consideration). Channel separation and the ability to adjust my iphone sound levels externally were a pleasant surprise (music selection advance/replay feature did not work with my iphone). The Amazon price compared to others made this quite satisfactory decision a "know" brainer!!

 review/text: I bought this headset with the hopes of being able to use it as they advertised. I was reallying wanting to use it with my phone for conference calls and with my computers for music and gaming. Addtionally I wanted to use Team Speak and Skype with it. I have yet to be able to connect the headset to any computer and I have tried 4 different bluetooth dongles all with different modes of failure. I can listen to music using the adapter that was included, and I can use it with my phone. However if I go to my phone with it I generally have to turn the headphones off to reconnect back to my music.The sound is pretty good and they are comfortable. People do mostly report having really good sound on thier end of the phone with them.I would never buy them and I would urge anyone consdering them to wait until somebody comes out with something that works.

 review/text: Overall Pros:* Fantastic sound when used as HEADPHONES with the supplied analog adapter.Overall Cons:* MONO sound when used as HEADSET with mic (both ears, just mono output)* LAGS behind video/game just under a second.* Tech Support nightmares. Dealt with liars and wiseasses.First, installed it on my primary box (XP SP2) with both a generic BTv1.1 adapter and then the IOGear GBU321. Used both dongle provided drivers and BlueSoliel drivers. In all situations, the sound quality was less than ideal as it sounded like it was being played through a speakerphone and found the headset (when mic is used) only outputting in MONO (no more listening to Pink Floyd during games). This annoyed me immediately as Tech Support TOLD me it was stereo output.This device is only good as a Skype headset or walk-around-the-house headphones (using the adapter).Secondly, this is what happened when I tried to contact Tech Support installing it on Vista (which did not work).Matt S:Hi, you have reached Matt S in Technical Support. How may I help you?You: I have a Plantronics 590a, and was wondering how I can pair it with VistaYou: my bluetooth dongle has been found and when I attempt to start the pairing process it asks me for drivers 4 times.You: upon inspection, this seems to be each of the services that the headset provides (Audio Sync, Remote control, Headset, and Telephony)Matt S: I can't support vista, so I'm not sure. as long as the pc supports the A2DP blue tooth Stereo profile, it should work. I don't know about different software applications however.You: anyone who can support vista?Matt S: Microsoft I would imagine.You: quite the sense of humor you have. I'm more curious as to the nature of your company and its vista driver support for its productsMatt S: We simply support the headset here, and not all the different applications and software programs out there.Matt S: we have an FAQ regarding vista on our Support page.Matt S: Thank you for choosing Plantronics.Let us know if you need further assistance.***** Matt S Has Disconnected

 review/summary: Great value for money
review/text: What everyone is saying here is true !This is a real good stereo bluetooth headset and a must have.I got myself the plantronics pulsar 590 A a month back after doing a lot of research on stereo bluetooth headsets.- Paired it easily with my HTC cruise.- Took me a while to pair it with my Toshiba laptop, but thats only because I didnt have the latest toshiba bluetooth stack on my laptop. Once I downloaded that, rest was easy.- The universal adapter works well too.Some of you may be confused as to what the difference is between 590 A and 590E. 590A includes the universal adapter which you can plug into any 3.5mm output while 590E is just the headset.The only thing that falls short is the styling - Plantronics could have bettered the styling a bit - this has been around for more than 2 years now.(n thats y I'm giving this a 4 star n not 5)But apart from that everything else is great - Sound quality is pretty good for music (deep base n crisp mids), and Ive also chatted for long hours with the headset on and roaming all over the house without any voice issues even once.To sum up - great value for money !

It doesn't have the stereo music capability, but I'm very happy with it's functionality as a phone headset

 review/text: This is a fine product made by a good company, but it appears to have compatibility issues not disclosed by either Plantronics or Amazon prior to sale. I was told by Plantronics tech support that the issue I was having was a "known problem."(See quoted email exchange below.)Pairing Problems with ATT 8525Discussion ThreadResponse (Michael P) 12/10/2007 05:19 AMMaury,This is a known issue with the HTC devices.Our Bluetooth headsets are not compatible with HTC devices.Thank you.Customer (Maury Christie) 12/07/2007 08:22 PMHi, I can successfully pair my 590a Headset with my ATT 8525 (HTC Hermes) running WM6 Professional, but when I turn off the headset, I find I must delete the pairing, and recreate the bluetooth profile in order to get it to work again. If I don't it behaves like this: I turn on my phone, turn on BT, push the call button on the 590a and turn it on. It goes into pairing mode, but for some reason it activates the Voice Speed Dial application on my phone, which I don't use.Shouldn't the phone and headset recognize each other each time I power up the BT and the 590, once the pairing has been set up?Question Reference #071207-000440Product Level 1: Bluetooth Mobile HeadsetsProduct Level 2: Pulsar 590a & 590eDate Created: 12/07/2007 08:22 PMLast Updated: 12/10/2007 05:19 AMStatus: WaitingRegion: USAMichael1-800-544-4660 x74171-866-544-4660 ID#5471This problem is still not resolved.

 review/summary: A few minor modifications and these are going to work out great!
 review/text: So I have a job where I'm constantly moving but fortunately can listen to music all day. The problem, of course, is that I'm happily working away and totally forget about the cords and wham! down goes the MP3 player onto the floor.The obvious solution? Cordless headset - so I got these and overall I really like them - sound quality is good, battery life is great, connection is solid, it works great with my phone and the hockey puck that attaches to the MP3 player at the same time, and the microphone is so good that people don't know I'm using a headset.There were only 2 problems, both of which are easily solvable. First, the adjustment thingies are too loose, so with a lot of movement and futzing around they will get out of adjustment. So I wrapped a bit of black electrical tape around them to lock the adjustment in place. Second, even though I have a pretty big head these headphones in their tightest position were a bit too big, so go down to the hardware store and get some of that black high-density foam that they use to seal camper shells to pickup trucks (the kind that has sticky-tape on one side), cut it into strips the width and length of the headband and stick it on there. If you're even halfway careful it'll look totally OEM.Plus, they stay in place a lot better with the foam.So I'm totally impressed with Plantronics - based on the quality of these headphones I got a bluetooth earpiece (voyager 510) and it's been great as well. I have a pile of dead bluetooth earpieces from Motorola and Nokia so it's nice to finally find one that works so well.

 review/summary: 590A is a terrific product. Great sound and support. Works perfectly with my ipod and blackberry phone at the same time.
 review/text: I purchased the Pulsar 590A 2 months ago. It is a terrific product. The sound is great. I purchased it to simultaneously connect to my ipod and Blackberry Pearl phone while walking. Again, I could not be more satisfied.In addition, Plantronics support is amazing. I asked them for the cost to just replace the adapter. I thought I broke it. They said it should be almost impossible to break with normal use. I got another Pulsar 590A headset and adapter without cost to me in less than a week.The unit is small and folds into a nice looking case. The light is no big deal. Very nice looking headphones. I do not understand anyone negatively reviewing this product.

 review/summary: The best in it's class
 review/text: A great product, bought it a month back here for a bargain. The headset paired up without any issues with my Samsung T509 phone, and the Dell Latitude D620 laptop. Crystal clear sound for both the parties. Talking over the phone in stereo is amazing, Works really well with Skype and Gtalk.The analog adapter is just amazing. With the analog adapter, music is amazing, the speakers have deep bass, crystal clear music. Without the adapter however, it won't work as my PC headphone, it pairs up but nothing is audible.If I had it on for over an hour it starts hurting my ears, the over the head design could be a bit slimmer and/or softer, it hurts my hairless head :o) As someone else mentioned, that blinking light makes it a pain to use in any public place. I used a black marker and painted over the light - not much help there :p

 review/summary: Audio lag - Otherwise good headphones
 review/text: Overall, good headphones. I won't really comment on the quality of the audio, because it's so subjective... but I can say that I'm satisfied. Using headphones without wires simply makes you wonder why they all can't be this way; once you try them, the convenience is hard to beat.The battery life appears to be excellent for both the headphones, and the analog adapter (which you also have to charge, it's the transmitter for the signal.) On full charge, my iPod died before the headset+transmitter. Nice.However, there are two issues to be aware of. Using the adapter, there is an audio lag. It's about .5 seconds. This isn't noticeable with audio, but once you watch video... it's a problem. I have a video iPod and was disappointed with the lack of lip-synching. Strangely, the lag appears to be slightly variable... sometimes it's half a second, but when I mute the audio with the headset, then unmute, the lag appears to be slightly less. Always present, but variable. In any case, it's enough where you will not want to watch television or a movie this way.Since I also wanted to use the headset in my home, without disturbing others at night, it's a significant drawback.The second issue is cosmetic, and a nitpick. In use, the headset flashes a bright blue ring of light around the right earphone. It's very bright and practically screams "Look at me!"Not really my bag, but that might be your thing. ;)--Update (12/23/2006)The quality of the plastics/assembly has proven disappointing.After several months, some hairline cracks appeared, and shortly afterwards, pieces of plastic around the hinges started breaking off. Internally, pieces began rattling as well... and after a year, it would no longer charge unless you moved one of the headphone speakers around in a specific position. Finally, the left headphone just gave up. Terrible!

 review/summary: Has some limitations but is a wonderful product
 review/text: I just received my 590a earlier this week and having been doing multiple levels of testing. First, I paired it with a Nokia 6600 cell phone. The quality is excellent on my side. The primary comment that I've received is that it seems to come through quieter on the other side. It's very comfortable for long calls though. After my initial pairing, I went into the phone options and manually connected the headphones. After that first setup, the phone would automatically pair once the headset was on.Using the universal adapter I paired it with my ipod after that. No problem with the sound quality overall. I can't say that it is the most amazing quality but I do enjoy the convenience of Bluetooth capability. Keeping it paired with a cell phone at the same time works well. Note that while the volume buttons seem to work, they are very stiff to press and not intuitive to locate while wearing them. It seems to work best if you pair the phone first and then turn on the adapter. I was getting some interruption when I tried it with the ipod first.Pairing with the computer...I have a Mac PowerBook G4 that I tested it on. Setup wasn't that bad but there is almost no documentation and the user guide that comes with the headset is very minimal to say the least. You do a normal Bluetooth pairing (same instructions as the phone in the users guide to make it discoverable). Once you have successfully paired it to the mac, you'll need to go into the system preferences and sound to manually set the output and input to "590Plantronics". I was the least impressed with sound quality here - at least concerning listening. I used GarageBand to test vocal recording and then ported that out as a podcast to see how the sound was. The sound quality was decent. I think that it will need some tweaking on the computer to get a better sound capability but I am quite happy with my purchase.The primary negatives that I found were the stiff buttons and as another reviewer pointed out, you can't have your computer and the cell phone paired at the same time. As long as you keep its limitations in mind, I think that it is a wonderful purchase.

 review/summary: Plantronics Pulsar 590A Bluetooth Stereo Headset
 review/text: I've been using this headset for about three months now, and although it was a little confusing at first, I've been very happy with it since I got everything working. I wanted a headset that I could use with VOIP for internet gaming, but something that I could also use for making Skype calls and listening to music wirelessly. This fits the bill pretty well. In order to use it as both a headset and headphones, I had to create two separate Bluetooth profiles on my computer. I just switch between the two for use as a headset or headphones (the sound quality is much better when used as headphones). The only drawback I have encountered is that some games with integrated VOIP do not recognize the headset as an input, but this is easily circumvented by using Teamspeak or Ventrilo, third-party VOIP software. It also comes with a Bluetooth reciever that can be plugged into any standard 1/8-inch audio jack, so you can go wireless with just about anything. Also included is a cable for use when on an airplane. Anyway... a neat little gadget.

 review/summary: Critics TOO Harsh? You Decide!
review/text: PROS:- Light weight solution for both an audio source and cell phone- Good sound quality on both ends- Comfortable fit- Travel case for protectionCONS:- 0.5 second delay when watching video (must use the hardwire solution)- The original MSRP is a bit high for something that is not closer to perfect- Not all of the audio controls work, even when using the dongle- CANNOT USE WHILE DRIVING (therefore you must have another headset for this purpose)I am looking into buying this unit from a friend's electronic's store. He was gracious enough to loan a floor model to me for a night. I spent some time reading reviews from many different sites and I have to say, while the reviews at Amazon were the most technically oriented, they were also the most critical. Therefore, I made it my goal to attept to disprove some of the claims that I read here in the hopes of finding this product to be a real gem. Among the claims that I attempted to disprove were:- Failure to charge- 0.5 second delay affecting video- Poor audio sound quality from dongle (i.e. when using an iPod/Laptop)- Hoaky switch between dongle and phone when making/receiving calls- Find the source of the "design flaw"The tests were done with the following items:- iBook G4 1.2Ghz- LG VX9800 (mine)- Motorola E815 (caller)- 5th Gen 60GB iPod Video- Belkin Bluetooth USB Adapter (model F8T003)The first tests that we ran, naturally, were to see if we could pair the VX9800 up with the headset. That took all of two seconds; very easy. I then walked into another room and called the E815. The quality was no better or worse then any of your other higher end bluetooth headsets. WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE is that you now have two ears focused in on the conversation, so in a sense, you're hearing more and paying attention more to the phone conversation (versus having the noise of the office in your other ear). I initally walked away from my cell phone and it got a bit garbled, but as soon as I brought my cell phone with me, I had no problems. I then switched phones with the caller so that I could hear what she was hearing. The quality was good. I didn't have any problems hearing what she was saying to me. Voice dial worked beautifully from the headset and I didn't find myself shouting.The next test that we did was to pair up the dongle and use it with the iPod (audio first). Pairing up the dongle was very easy. While Edward Rios claims that the audio he heard was "no better then AM radio", I firmly disagree with this statement. I started out playing some classical (with no EQ settings set on the iPod). I'll agree that the quality of the audio was not on the same level as my Seinnheiser's, however once I adjusted the EQ in the iPod the bass and thus the quality was improved somewhat (Bass Booster setting worked well). I also noticed that the track jogger did not work with the iPod. In the manual it states "Only works if Bluetooth device supports Bluetooth Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP); does not work when using universal adapter." This was a bit disappointing because it was feature I was looking forward to. The "PLAY/PAUSE" button did work... somewhat. The audio pauses, but not on the iPod. Next we moved on to receiving a phone call. As a call came in, I heard a beep in the headset. Pressing the call button, the music stopped and the call interrupted. Once the call was complete, the phone hung up and the music continued (please note that the ipod did not pause during this time, only the source of the signal switched). This was tested several times. It was very easy. However, I do agree with Steve Gardner in his assessment that the dongle is a short term pair. In other words, if you turn the dongle off, you will need to pair it again (once again, a very simple process).On to the video. I turned on some Family Guy that I had on my iPod. I indeed did notice that there was some amount of delay, but with cartoon characters, it wasn't that obvious. Not a problem, I decided to up the ante. I then turned on an episode of The Office, specifically a scene where Steve Carrell is speaking. Yes, there IS a .05 second delay. It seems to fluctuate as if the dongle is racing to catch up. I then put the Pulsar in headset mode by turning it off and plugging in the hardwire cable. This fixed the problem (this same resolution was found by both testers). My final thoughts on this? Unless you're planning on trying to watch video from across the room, this solution will work for you.Feeling a bit adventurous, I decided to test the headset with my iBook. I first tried to pair the Pulsar up with my iBook using the Belkin BT adapter. That didn't work. Although I heard it clicking when the pairing process was going on, it never went through. Not a problem, I'll use the dongle. Using the dongle I was again able to hear the audio, but I was not able to get the unit to work as a mic/headphone combination. Others have claimed to be able to get this to work, but for the average person, the short answer is that it doesn't work that great. I'm going to take N. Nelson's comments one step further, if I may, and say that this unit is really only for Audio Sources / Cell Phone combinations.At the end of the night I decided to charge it. I placed it in the cradle and, sure enough, it started charging. At some point later I picked it up and then placed it back in the cradle and it didn't charge! I thought, "A'HA! I proved another one true!" Not so fast... I took out the USB charger to see if the problem was the cable and began charging the headset off of that. A few minutes later I put the headset back in the cradle and low and behold, it began charging again! Is there a hardware problem here? I'm not sure, but that is what I found. It charged smoothly the rest of the night.Unfortunately, the one thing I was not able to test in a 24 hour time span was the design flaw. Obviously I would have to use it every day for two weeks to see if this is true. My gut instinct is telling me that it's possible a bad batch of product is to blame, but I have no way of proving this. Until I see it, I can't put faith in that it will happen to me. All I will say on this is that it apparently has happened to more then one person so it is possible that it could happen to you. One thing I did notice is that the headset gets "stretched" as you wear it, but then it gets "compressed" as you put it back in the cradle. Could it be that all this stretching AND compressing is causing the cracks? Would this have happened to these people if they didn't use the cradle? I don't know. Maybe the design flaw is in the cradle itself and NOT the headset. Who knows...My final analysis of this product overall is very good. I don't think Plantronics set out to make this the "one stop shop" for all headset needs (although they might want to have a conversation with their marketing department about "truth in advertising"). While I was typing this I was listening to some good ol' fashioned punk rock using the dongle and I was bouncing my head the whole time; very enjoyable. I do believe that Plantronics is preparing for the next wave in Bluetooth technology by adding support for profiles that others don't support YET. All in all, if you're looking for a headset that can seamlessly switch between your cellphone and your iPod, then this will work for you. If you're looking for an "one stop shop" you will be sorely disappointed. One thing I would have liked to see would be some sort of design improvement where one of the earphones could flip outward thus to be legally complaint with driving requirements. They are the best option available (the Motorola pair does not come with a transeiver which is something you have to purchase extra... and something else you have to carry and something else you run the risk of losing). In the end, will I buy these? Probably, but I won't be running towards the store like a bat out of hell.

review/summary: $250 hassle aka 590A
 review/text: Pros- they look great- handy wired dongle and charging stand- very good sound quality- comfortable and lightCons- distracting blue light flashing (it's bluetooth I get it already)- slight sound lag- every once in a while signal drops out replaced by grating static sound (can be fixed by pressing the link button, but is jarring none the less).- after a few weeks the charging connector pin on the headphones became faulty and stopped taking a charge. was still able to get a charge by placing headphones at a *very specific* angle connected to the portable charging cable. annoying to say the least, but workable.- after about two months (ten minutes ago) the plastic on the headphones cracked and fell apart leaving the left earphone dangling by a wire. I was very careful with these comparatively expensive headphones and had never dropped them.It's a shame, initially it seemed close to perfect.Be aware that Plantronics does not offer refunds, only replacements.

 review/summary: No more wires and a little more practicality
 review/text: I'm an audiophile more than a cellphonephile. So when I was referred to this item by a friend, I checked the specs and found that this matched my needs and more. I was looking for a headset that could leave me wires and hands free to my iPod, however, this benefitted me a little more since I could marry this up with my Blackberry too. I've had it for three days now and I'm very happy with it. Below are some PRO's and CON's to consider when recommending it to others.PRO's- Much better sound quality than expected. Play with iPodequalizer and you get the sound that you want out of it.Don't expect noise canceling quality -- just enjoy the factthat there are no more wires!- Extremely easy set up to iPod and bluetooth phone.- Excellent iPod to cell phone call transfer ability.- Bluetooth range for analog far better than expected. Icontinued to get high-quality sound past 50ft.- Very light weight and practical to wear.- Nice carrying case.CON's- There is definately a lag in voice to video but it's notcompletely unbearable.- The analog adapter and headset status lights are a bit tacky.I got on an elevator and saw Danny Disco in the mirror withall the blue flashing status lights between the analog deviceand the headset. Just hide your pod and deal with the headset.- Big downside for iPod gen 5 - no track forwarding or back. Iassume it works with all previous generations.- Light weight headset means lightweight plastic. Take care ofit and don't sit on it as the plastic is that of cheapsunglasses.Hope this helps the masses.Happy consumer.

 review/text: received this headphones this morningthe headphones is comfortable and firm (earpieces may be kinda tight)it also comes with USB charge cable, regular headphones cable (used when it's turned off as regular headphones), AC adaptor, charge stand (I don't use it anyway), a casethe sound is pretty good, whether through wireless or hard-wired, bass is full and deep, mid and treble are well-balanced, since it's fully open air design, it should be pretty comfortable when listening (no hollow effect), and the sensitivity is pretty high when hard wired (single battery walkman is OK)the analog audio adaptor is another plus, it can also be used with moto HT820 (same passcode)the RF of the headphones is good as well, it claims 10m radius range, it really has 10 meters, I can get even more range with class 1 bt adaptorI worried about the hinge breakage, but after examine, I found out why: when you use charge stand, fully extend the headband, and let the earpieces face each other to prevent breaking, or simply use AC adaptor or USB charge cable directly (the jack is located on the left)the handsfree works pretty well with nokia 6270, loud and clear on both sidesno dropoffs on a2dp with T-Mobile MDA and Dell X51v, about audio lag, I notice all bt a2dp clients have same issue (moto HT820, itech R35)the only thing I don't like is buttons layout, the volume control should be located up and down, but now they're located left and rightconclusion: this model is one of the few over the head bt headset, and this one works exceptionally well, the money is pretty worth spent, I'd give 96/100, better than 91/100 for HT820

 review/summary: What I found missing in other reviews
 review/text: As there are some other excellent reviews here, I am concentrating on what has not been written.Sound quality varies, depending on how you use the headphones. Basically, both comparisons with AM radio and HiFi Sound are more or less true. Here is why.I find the earphones of an excellent quality at low to middle sound levels, delivering sound better than my Koss Porta Pro and on par with Sennheiser PC-150. But this is only true, when the earphones are wired to the source. It is also loud, at 50% PB output level sound get unbearable. Good sensitivity and sound detail.Using the including Bluetooth dongle, quality slips to the level of FM radio. Using it with iPod, which does not offer that good output quality (at least no comparison to my Al PowerBook 1.5GHz), quality slips a bit further. This is partially due to limitation of the Bluetooth and the fact that sound is amplified twice (both in iPod and headset).Further gets worse :(. By connecting vie Bluetooth to the PowerBook, quality does goet to the level of the AM Radio, as Mac currently do not support A2DP Bluetooth profile for improved audio quality. It is really a no go for listening to music, and Skype quality drops to the level of a normal phone.To get it working, however, there is one thing to keep in mind. I guess, Macs do not support another feature of Bluetooth, multi-access. Since I am using headset as a phone headset as well, it is constanly connected to the mobile phone. It seems like macs do not like sharing headsets, so bluetooth on the mobile phone has to be switched off. Otherwise, no problem whatsoever. Dongle-phone (SONY Ericsson K750i) combination works perfect and is REALLY cool stuff. It switches sources, once you get a call and then switches back to the iPod.Basically, I am keeping the headset, as getting rid of the wires on the go is worth the sound quality penalty. For a good quality, 3.5 mm jack is the only option for some time to come, in my opinion.So, this is an awesome product, well designed, very well built. If it suffers some quality issues, it is actually due to the limitations of the technology, not the product. I had no problems with charging, as did some other users. Another batch maybe :p. Accordingly, 5 stars for the product, 1 star penalty for inperfect technology (Bluetooth and Mac), 4 Stars in total.Oh! One annoying thing, there is a blinking blue ring light on the right earphone. At night it is really bright, so you'll end up looking like a lighthouse. During the day it is not that obvious. Still annoying, as I would prefer to use my cool headset rather discreetely.

 review/summary: The perfect headset
 review/text: All I can say is...wow!I have been waiting for the longest time for a binural (two speaker) wireless headset that actually worked well and didn't have a bulky battery pack.This headset went far and above my expectations. So enough about the praise, here's the nitty gritty.Ordered my unit from Amazon, received it within 5 days.Setup the headset with my Motorola Razr, worked like a charm, but this isn't why I bought it. I bought it to be used with my computer, as I develop web based audio/video conferencing solutions. So I tried using the headset with my Bluetooth 1.2 Adapter (cheapy from Walmart) - It took a little bit of setup (had to upgrade the bluetooth stack on windows xp, then pair the headset with the computer. I got it to work, but the audio didn't sound very good. It sounded a lot like a record.Seeing as how the headset is Bluetooth 2.0 I decided to purchase a bluetooth 2.0 adapter. Found a kingston unit at BestBuy for $40.00, installed this unit. (This time setup was easier as the kingston install removed the old bluetooth software and installed the new) - This time the audio was incredible, CD quality.Microphone is very sensitive, was able to pick up a co-worker's voice 10 feet away crystal clear.Over-all I highly recommend this unit - a little pricey, but worth every penny!

 review/summary: BEWARE!
 review/text: I just received my headset and bluetooth 1.2 adapter. I am warning all who buy this with plans to use it with a computer. It will only do stereo music when the microphone is disabled. Making the features work with a computer are to say the least "very glitchy". If you enable the microphone you will only get poor quality 22khz phone type sound (very muffled and indistict). When it comes to pairing, you cannot pair it to your computer and use the microphone and also pair it to your cell phone, it is either or. The computer takes the place of the cell phone. It does however work extremely well with the included headset adaptor. It is really cool. If you pair it with your cellphone and the use the adaptor you will recieve a beep in your ear when a call is incoming. You can also listen to stereo music from you computer (if you mess around long enough). It also has incredible range. Anyway dont buy this for multiple uses. It is only for IPOD + Cell phone, thats it. Getting it to work on a computer is a incredible pain.

 review/summary: Nice product, bought my daughter one
 review/text: I've been using this product for about 6 months. My daughter borrowed it on a number of occasions to use with her iPod, and liked it. I felt good enough about the product to buy one for her for her birthday recently.My initial interest was listening to my computer, and to a lesser extent my iPod, without wires. RF type wireless headphones don't cut it for me, but these don't get static interference.The cellphone headset capability was an added bonus, but a nice one. I generally put my phone on speakerphone mode and wedge it against my sun visor. This works well for me. However, I recently used the Plantronics while talking to my parents during a drive home for about 15 minutes. It can be tricky to talk to them on the phone but this setup takes the quality of the sound up a notch and really helped.Don't expect you can be rough with it, but I've had no problems. There are some buttons and sync-delays and it is a wireless and bluetooth device. Don't think it is as simple as a wired device without those failure or configuration modes. It has not been a problem for me.I recommend this product.-CB-

 review/summary: 590 bluetooth headset
 review/text: The dual ear piece is fantastic in a truck where the decimal level is very high. However, as good as it sounds in your ears, it needs to be balanced with a noise canceling microphone. Plantronics has some very good noise canceling microphones on some hard wired headsets that cost less money. It is quite reliable, comfortable and a charge lasts a long time. This is excellent in a low noise environment.

 review/text: I purchased my first headset in Dec 05, after one week of use the unit would not charge, but Plantronics was good enough to send me another one seeing how it was still under warranty! Received the replacement unit mid Jan 06, as of yesterday the unit started having the same problem as the first one; i'm no longer able to charge it. I expected a better design/quality product from Plantronics! I'm now waiting on yet another replacement unit!

review/summary: Plantronics Pulsar 590A- Good Product
 review/text: After my last headset purchase disaster, I wanted to give this headset a good going over before writing the review. I give this a passing grade.Pros- Decent sound, Cell conversations come out both speakers, Good range of distance from Bluetooth source, Short boom mic actually works very well, easy pairing, included adaptor and carrying case.Cons- The blasted flashing blue light. No, this thing is like a flash light in the dark.I read other's complaints about this light. So before I bought, I considered: I'll just put a piece of black tape on the LED. Uhmm no. This light comes from around the whole circumference of the headset controls. I think the only fix will be to size and glue a rubber O-ring around the edge to block the very annoying light. Not so much for the wearer but for the poor passenger in a car sitting to your right!Given my hearing loss having a cell conversation in both ears really helps. I was concerned about the little short boom mic (tube), but my wife gave it the best compliment when she says she can't tell the difference between direct phone conversation or via the headset.I find I use the included Bluetooth adaptor quite a bit on my computer. When a call comes in while listening to music or such on the headset, the sound is automaticaly muted and the phone gets priority and takes control until the end of the call. I've also found that when my Moto Q9H phone chimes to let me know an Email or text msg has arrived, the sound source from the dongle mutes then too, then comes back on.The headset does have a mute button for the mic and there is a reminder beep every couple of minutes letting you know that you are on mute. (not bad) The other controls include a Phone Function Button, Vol up/down and Trk Fwd/Trk Bkw function for supported MP3 Players.The charger connections are a bit odd and care must be taken to insure a firm and proper connection. The charger has two leads so the dongle and the headset can both charge simultaneously.The headset utilizes the new: Bluetooth Advanced Audio Profile so if you want to use the advanced features make sure your Bluetooth device supports this new profile, else you'll need to use the included Bluetooth adaptor.Note: the 590A includes the carrying case, dongle, spare mic tube, charging stand and charger, in-flight cable (disables the Bluetooth and goes wired) and universal 3.5mm cable. The 590E only comes with the charger. So decide if the extras are worth the extra price. For my money they are.Thus far I've had no problems with anything breaking as others have reported and I'm not extra gentle with them.

 review/summary: Pleasantly surprised.
 review/text: After reading the other reviews on this product I was REALLY apprehensive about purchasing it. About a month later I can report I'm glad I bought these. Let's set some perspective here. This is a Bluetooth wireless headset, your fidelity will NEVER be as good as a wired headset and you will always be subject to some interference from other wireless devices. This is the nature of the technology and is unavoidable. You have to decide whether or not the compromises are worth the benefit of wireless.I've used several Bluetooth headsets and handsfree units and this one stays connected better with fewer problems than my previous two. The switching between the stereo music and phone headset works really well. The multipoint feature works really well whether it is paired with the included analog adapter or a Bluetooth dongle. Again, a call comes in, it switches over to the call, and then switches back on call termination.Like some others have mentioned, this headset is pretty high on the geek scale, so if you're worried about looking like a geek, look elsewhere for one of those slick in-the-ear models. The geek factor is amplified by the large blue blinking circle on the right ear. I took a silver sharpie and colored carefully around the ring which tones it down considerably.The charging is a little wonky, you have to get them aligned just right in the stand.A really nice thing is that the phone calls are played binaurally which helps to isolate outside noise.The only thing that's been tough to deal with on this headset is the absence of sidetone in the headset. Most phones and headsets leak a little of your voice into the earpiece so you can hear yourself talking. This headset does not do that which because it covers both ears has taken some getting used to. You just have to take it on faith that people on the other end can hear you since you can't hear yourself. This is the one thing I'd change about it.For me the wireless compromises were worth the benefit of a good general purpose headset with stereo music capability. Thankfully I haven't seen any of the durability issues that were mentioned in other reviews after a month of heavy use. If it starts to fall apart, I'll leave a follow-up review but after a month of use I would still recommend it.

 review/summary: Works just great
 review/text: This is one of the few times I've encountered a product of this type that actually does what you'd expect and rather well. I have a Dell Axim X50v with built in blue tooth (and the necessary stereo bluetooth driver) and a Blackberry. I use the BT adapter to connect to my iPod video. Stereo sound is excellent, good bass, etc. Although the Blackberry has no stereo supporting apps, the headset supports mono just fine. Very good telephone clarity both sending and receiving. Love the retractable tube mike. One other important thing I learned after I got it (I couldn't find this on Amazon), is that it comes with a direct attach cable for use on airplanes.The only shortcoming is the huge, bright blue blinking ring on one earcup. Major overkill, and a bit embarrassing. But handy for walking in parking lots at night and letting everyone within 1/2 mile that you are there.Comes with a very good and compact semi-hard case to protect them during travel. One last thing, setup was completely effortless.

 review/summary: I love these headphones!
 review/text: I like everything wireless, and these headphones are awesome!I was able to pair them with my phone, it's an LG vx8600 with the mp3 player. The headphones sound great, and I can even change tracks, and adjust volume with the buttons on the headphone.When a call comes in, I hear it through the headphones, and press a button to answer. Everyone I talk to says the voice quality sounds really good on their end, after the call is over, the music resumes. You can also voice dial, so you really don't have to take your phone out of your pocket.I also paired them with my computer, I used a bluetooth program called BlueSoleil, and a generic dongle. It took me a while to figure out that I had to go into the sound menu on my computer, and set the bluetooth device as the default sound input. Once I got it working, it sounds even better than with my phone. Itunes sounds really good, because you can use the equalizer to tweak the sound to your liking.The batteries last a long time, I've been using these a lot since I got them a few days ago, and haven't had to charge them yet.When playing games, and watching video, there is a little lag between, the picture and sound, but it doesn't bother me much.The little transmitter works great too. I plugged it into my computer sound port, before I got the bluesoleil working, and it paired right up, and sounds good.Bottom line, so far, I don't have any thing but praise for these headphones!

Only had headset connection available, so sound quality not the greatest.XP with Start Key USB BT - easy install and connect. Only had headset connection available, so sound quality not the greatest.XP via Boot camp on mini mac- Driver hell. Don't waste your time doing this.hooking to other devices via the 1/8" jack transmitter - works pretty good, with good sound quality. Some strange behavior every once in a while.. the headphones would drop the sound an let out a shrill beep sound until you turn them off and reconnect. Can't figure out why this happens only occasionally.Skype works well with this, just make sure you have a well charged battery or the call gets dropped.

 review/summary: Great choice for Sprint Instinct
 review/text: I searched high and low for a overhead headset for my new Sprint Instinct. Nothing was in the market except ear buds which I'm not comfortable wearing. I found this product and it's perfect. I can hear clearly, it's mobile, carries a long charge and folds up small (with case) for traveling. Actually the sounds so good that on my last overseas flight I left the BOSE home and used the included airplane mode and connector to listen to films, music and work on my computer. Granted, they aren't noise canceling like the BOSE, but it was great to just carry one small headset instead on two. I've had these about a month and haven't found any issues. Yes, the volume is clumsy and a little hard to use on the side of the air pieces, but I rarely need to make adjustments since the sound is clear.

 review/summary: It works on Intel MacBook Pro under OSX 10.5.x
 review/text: I love this headset...Well, I have had my Plantronics Pulsar 590A for some years, but have just ordered another one! I think I paid the full price for my original one, but it has been worth every penny.As I write this review, on my Intel MacBook Pro I am listening to some great music from iTunes. Fortunately, the new Intel Macs, with Leopard OSX 10.5.x have much better Bluetooth 2 support including "Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP): Controls stereo audio headphones" (which unfortunately, my iPhone 3G does not). So if you look at the Plantronics website and do a compatibility check for Apple, Leapard OSX 10.5.x it states that this headset is not compatible, which they are wrong about (and I have already told them that, some time ago). I a caveat to that statement though, which I will detail later.Well what can I say about its use?1. First of all, the sound quality is really excellent. You would be hard pressed to get a different wired headset that is better without paying a lot more money.2. They are great to wear, being light and well fitting for your head. You also do not feel totally closed in like you do with some.3. The Bluetooth implementation seems to be very good. I also have a set of Motorola "Bluetooth DJ Headphones", which fail on my first two points above and seem a bit "dicey" on their Bluetooth implementation. I have been amazed at the range I can get with the Plantronics - using the audio adapter with an older Mac at my old office, I could happily walk round most of the inside of the building, or outside, while streaming music from my Mac.4. I can pair the Headset with two devices similtaneously. Previously, I used to do that with the adapter for music from my old Mac and my Treo 650 for taking phone calls, now I do it with my new Mac laptop and my iPhone 3G for phone calls. It switches between the two with no problem, when you take a phone call. I also use Skype on my new Mac, and when I make or answer a Skype voice call, it can automatically pause iTunes (or just mute it, depending on how you configure it).5. You have full play and track control of iTunes on the Mac using it (but not the iPhone 3G, as you have to use the adapter for iTunes on that).6. The quality construction is wonderful. Nothing is likely to break, and has not on mine, with a lot of use.This leads to my caveat:The headset supports both the Bluetooth "headphones" profile (for high quality audio) and "headset" profile for use with the mic for chatting on the phone or Skype. Well there seems to be a problem with the mic side of the Headset profile on my Mac - it gets garbled sound. Hopefully that is a OS problem that they will fix, but for the moment, I listen to Skype voice calls using the Headphones profile and the internal mic on the laptop for my voice (and this works quite well). This is not a problem when using it for phone calls with my iPhone 3G where the mic works well.All in all, I still love this headset and highly recommend it for anyone who loves good sound with the freedom of no wires. I have even used it with Windoze and a Bluetooth dongle (but mostly use a DSP Plantronics USB headset for a PC, as I am generally using it for games then!).At the discounted price it is a real bargain. Buy it, you will not be sorry!

 review/summary: Easy to good, good fidelity, great while exercising!
 review/text: I've have this headset a month now for use with my Ipod, and it certainly is a keeper.Pros:- Easy to use- Amazing range, I've been out to 50ft.- Good volumeCons:- Charging setup. While the headsets fit into a nice charging stand, the transmitter dangles at the end of the charger cord, not very elegant. I'm also questioning the longevity of the "snap plugs" that are used for the power connection.- Volume is good, bass response is excellent and the headphones have crisp high-end response. I occasionally pick up some digital artifacts on extended high-frequency notes...a group of strings playing in the upper register, for example. With Bluetooth headsets in general, I have heard much worse. This is not a deal-breaker, and I am a bit of an audio snob.While it does work quite well in mobile phone applications, It makes for a pretty geeky fashion statement. I have used it only occasionally as a communication device.A nice, well engineered bluetooth headset.

 review/summary: Good Sound BAD Construction/Design/Material
review/text: GOOD:The unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. Pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.BAD:The design of the headset unit is rather small. The (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear "cups" (speakers) are very cheap. The top (black) part is rather stiff.UGLY:If you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. When you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. It will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear "cup" units.BOTTOM LINE:If you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. Otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break.

I bought this unit with some trepidation as I've had poor results with previous Bluetooth connections.This one is perfect. It paired on the first try. Sounds good, lets me know about an incoming call. The microphone part doesn't sound great according to people I tried it with but it worked well enough.

 review/text: Seems like a simple goal - to make a product that works well for all conceivable purposes. This one is the first thing I have owned in my entire life that gets pretty close. I expect from my head set that I can- listen to music at home (from the stereo set in the living room)- listen to music at work (Bluetooth from the laptop)- listen to music on the train, in the mall, ... (from my T-Mobile Shadow)- use it on airplanes (wired)- take phone calls while listening to music- have a clear phone conversation even when in a noisy environment- be wire-free while doing all this- do not have to recharge the device for days despite heavy use- use it in wired mode when out of battery, or to conserve battery- have acceptable sound quality and decent volume even when on batteryYou do not need another headset period. This thing does it all, and it does it well. I am very happy with it.

 review/text: This item leaves me wondering... HOW did i exist before i had it!No more getting up from the computer to nearly kill myself because i'm still attached. I can wander around my house doing assorted things while maintaining a conversation with my friends. I can listen to my work related phone messages in privacy, and without interruption.I like the flexibility these headphones give me and while I was skeptical of the voice tube, I gave it a shot because I have been a user for years of Plantronics call center headsets and they are top notch.I have since bought one for a friend and recommended it to many others and we all love them.My only disappointment is that the the post on one side is starting to crack a little bit, but that is with exceptionally heavy use -- probably 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.Wouldn't hesitate to buy another.

 review/summary: A fabulous device, unmatched by any other
 review/text: The Pulsar 590A is without a doubt the finest BlueTooth device I have ever used. The 11 hour battery life is unmatched, and the versatility of telephone or audio headset, wired or wireless operation is similarly unparalleled. It looks elegant in its charging stand and the "hockey puck" analog adapter that turns any headphone jack into a stereo Bluetooth transmitter is worth its weight in Platinum.The only problem is the $245 MSRP price tag. Fortunately I acquired mine for $110 through Amazon, and at that price it is a bargain impossible to turn down. Plantronics is the headset company that equipped the Apollo astronauts and Mission Control, and they make industrial strength equipment. They also were the vendor of choice for the old Bell System; if you've talked with a Telephone Operator, they probably were using a Plantronics headset.If you can find it at a reasonable discount, as I did, BUY IT. You will not regret the purchase.

 review/text: Bought this otherwise fantastic product. Could not charge it ater a few weeks of use. Then got another one and could not charge it after a few weeks of use. Then they sent another one 3 days ago and it has just stopped charging.And when I call the customer service they told me that it was the FIRST time they heard someone having a charging problem with Plantronics 590a. Somehow I am having a hard time believing them. I feel they are getting dozens of calls each day.Any other readers - if you are having a similar experience - pl post your charging woes.Sad that this is an otherwise good product. But unusuable due to this problem. I recommend prospective buyers to hold off until these design flaws or fixed. Or a competitor beats them to it.

review/summary: Good Performance, Easy Pairing, Flimsy Construction
 review/text: I have used these headsets for more than 4 years with my iPod classic, iPod Touch and a variety of Bluetooth cell phones. They are easy to pair, feel comfortable and the sound quality is very good. Battery life is fairly long - for my use, almost a week. The Bluetooth adapter that comes with 590A fits very snugly into the iPod 3.5 mm audio jack (unlike many others). Telescopic microphone is unobtrusive, works well on cell phones and the listeners at other end don't complain of poor voice quality.The main drawback of these headsets is their flimsy construction, cheap plastic. One of the cables became loose after a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked. So the sound from one side is intermittent now. But I was able to use it for 2 more years after taping it! Other cons include tiny and poorly placed controls - almost unusable while wearing headsets, very bright blue light and they do not cover the ears completely so there is no blockage of background sound.They are not the perfect Bluetooth headphones but in my experience they have worked better than the other ones that I have tried -ILUV i903 Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, Logitech andPlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones. Finally, after 4 years, both sides plastic broke, and I had to replace them with Samsung WEP870 Bluetooth Headset (Black).

 review/text: The bluetooth connection to the Motorola phone doesn't connect easily. It worked well once connected.The headset needs some additional padding for comfort.I used it with my iPod and it worked well if the comfort was better.But the main purpose I purchased this for was to connect to my computer and Skype phone. I haven't figured out how to get the mike to work for this purpose.

 review/summary: Excellent Product
 review/text: I bought this based on reviews. I've always wanted cordless headphones but I didn't want ear buds because I wanted a better sound. These headphones are great. The sound is good. The price is good. Ive been using them for a month now and they are still in excellent condition. The other reviews are correct-the signal is still strong at 30 feet. The adapter also works for my tv so I can watch a movie while my wife sleeps and she doesnt have to hear the sound. The phone calls are clear on both ends. Only negative is that my ears get a little hot with the headphones but its winter now and I welcome it. July-Aug may be a different story.

 review/summary: Not Mac-Friendly...if you use bluetooth feature
 review/text: After an hour of trying to use the headphones with my Macbook Pro 2.16 ghz using the bluetooth feature I almost gave up but found a forum that mentioned how to change the sound setting on the laptop. I did so and was able to listen to itunes. The audio was least to say "bearable" but really I would rather use my little walmart earbuds that aren't wireless if listening for a longer period of time. The audio is "bearable" in total because depending on your position from the laptop is a huge factor, and you can't move your head alot. For some reason I could only use them to listen to itunes and when I tried to listen to any web music like on imeem or youtube I got nothing! As a headset for bluetooth...well I tried to pair it with my htc touch pro and it didn't show up but well I would not even dare to step outside wearing these things, I could just get a sleek ultra cool little bluetooth headset even if its on one ear only.Other than the bluetooth problems if you use the universal adapter the audio is actually pretty good, along the lines of any $20 earbuds or wrap around ear phones (which is the only things I can afford and ever used...except for these which i received as a gift) and I could use any application and surf music all over the web and go as almost 30ft away from the adapter/laptop.For the cost of about 120+ I do recommend if the most important thing is having a wireless headphones. Blueooth capabilities are a shame but with the adapter then they are well worth it. Still if you are gonna fork over some cash you should look for something that is the best...for recommendations look at http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=235484

 review/text: Bought this gift for my husband for Christmas. He is a driver and loves to listen to music. The sound is awesome! The blue light is not a problem at all, which is something I was concerned with due to reading other reviews. My husband uses it with his Ipod and cell phone and says it was his favorite gift. His friends at work were also impressed and wanted more information on it. A great buy!

 review/summary: excellent sound, easy pairing
 review/text: I've had these headphones for about 3 years now and love them! I've paired them with an HP computer, a Wind netbook, a Mac laptop, a Palm Treo, a Palm Centro, and an ipod. I never used the included bluetooth dongle but never had any problems with pairing or with dropping the connection. You have to remember the typical range of a bluetooth connection is only about 12-15m, no matter what devices you use. Contrary to other reviews, I have also paired these with a device that does not allow you to add a passkey code. Battery life is excellent, even after years of use. Headphones have held up well, but the head band (the part that goes over the top of your head) is not the most comfortable. Get these and get yourself free of those wires!

 review/summary: I use this headset for gaming on my PC.
 review/text: Overall I am satisfied with these headphones, but the lag is very bad for gaming. I have tried different sound cards, settings etc. But there is always a lag that seems to range from 1-2 seconds. The bluetooth "dongle" that you use to connect seems to have an impact on this because I have tried 3 and depending on the drivers, reduced the lag. I have also tried this same setup with a Jabra and these headphones perform much better.A huge drawback for Gaming is that you can't get the HD Audio (Stereo) if you want to use the Mic! This kills me. I can't listen to the audio of my game in Stereo if I want to be able to talk on the mic for voice communication with someone while I play. As far as I know this is the most expensive bluetooth headset like this out there. It's also the newest bluetooth standard I beleive. I find this very disappointing considering I can't find any non bluetooth options out there and this is the latest and greatest...

 review/summary: Almost 5 star, just barely
 review/text: I just love this product. As noted in other reviews this unit does have some flaws and short comings but if you are not asking them to do more then they were made for I think they are wonderful.I purchased this to do three things(1) lissen to my audio books on my Zen Micro:This has been great, sound quality is very good, I can usually get 30ft indoors with out interruption. A great added bonus is when I sinch up the headphones to there smallest size they end up just shy of covering my left ear so I can use them while driving (against the law in FL to drive with both ears covered).(2) my phone a Treo 650:These have been the best phone head sets by far. I have not been able to find one of the smaller ones that I can really hear well (have tried several). People are usually very supprised to find out I was using a headset. Answering a call is pritty seamless, would be nice if it would pause my mp3 player but thats my players fault.(3) to use at home to lissen to TV after my wife goes to bed.This has worked out wonderfully, except the half second delay. It may even be less. I have not had any problems with loud sound effects in movies or with music.Other then that can creak alittle, may have tighten up a couple screws, they have been great!

 review/summary: Plantronics! Build them and they will come!
 review/text: I have been waiting so very long for a headset with technology that offers clean clear wireless reception, a headset that works with my computer, my home entertainment center, and my phone. A headset that flawlessly switches from listening to music / TV / PC / movies and answer an incoming call automatically -- yes the Plantronics Pulsar 590A is all that -- however the romance stops there.I received my 590's October 2005 for about $250CAN with shipping. Within the first month they developed a crack abut 1.5 inches long on the outside of the silver portion where the headband slides in for adjustments. Today 1may2006 I see cracks on both the inside panels or on the opposing side of the first crack mentioned.I was willing to live with one crack although concerned now though with three cracks these babies are going back to Plantronics!Further, I have treated these with extreme care and have never dropped them.Pros:Simply put they work as advertised with little to no playing around to get them to connect to other sources or devices.When talking with people they can actually hear what I am saying and I can actually hear them loud and clear (volume control works nicely here as well).Oh, and I love the blue light. Ya I'm a GEEK and proud of it!Cons:Very flimsy.Very Weak.Easily broken.Although the sound is clear and clean ie not all staticy -- THX they are not. Not even close.Plantronics! Build them and they will come!

 review/summary: You can't go wrong with this unless you don't like the style or color.
review/text: This A2DP bluetooth headphone is excellent. When listening to music I hear instruments that I don't hear on my home or car system and this headphone has awed every friend or co-worker that has tried it on and listened to it. It is very functional (provided you are right handed) with almost any accessory that you need already included including a hard case to carry it all in and a dongle to use with any headphone out jack. Sound is awesome whether it comes from my phone, PC, or TV. Another plus is that Plantronics seems to be using a common charge port for their different bluetooth products. You have the ability to charge this using AC or via USB with both charger cords included. The phone functions are great too. People I have talked to on this headphone say it sounds nearly as good as speaking right into the phone. It also comes with a charging stand to use at home or work. You won't be disappointed unless you hate the style and color. I've used Plantronics headsets in the television industry since the 70's and based on past experience knew I was buying a quality product.

review/summary: Fantastic and flexible headphone/headset
 review/text: One of the best buys I've ever made. I've been looking for a good wireless headphone for 20 years (really!), but never found a set that was comfortable and had clear sound without interference. All the ones I tried were RF analogue ones, and they always seemed to have crackles etc.Now Bluetooth technology had matured I decided to fork out the cash for the Plantronics. I live in Australia so had them ordered from the US (saved about AU$50). A switching powersupply is included, so I only needed a plugadaptor for OZ power sockets. The set is fantastically complete, with a great protective travel case and other bits that are very useful. I hadn't heard of Plantronics before, but recently have seen their headsets being used by receptionists - so they should know about making reliable products!I've had them for a week now, and am using them with my laptop, desktop, iPaq 6515 and home stereo (via the 3.5mm analogue bluetooth adaptor). It installed/worked without a hitch with all these. Stereo sound quality is great - more than sufficient for me (considering MP3 isn't perfect either), and I find them really comfortable. I also love how incoming phonecalls and/or directions from my GPS software just temporarily interrupt the music. With the iPaq I can also switch music tracks easily with the buttons on the headphone. This doesn't seem to be supported by the bluetooth tools and/or iTunes/Windows Media Player under XP, but that doesn't worry me because I'm at the keyboard then anyway...People can hear me well when I'm on the mobile phone using them as a headset. I haven't tried them with VoIP yet, but other reviews indicate success, and I don't doubt they'll work fine.I only have two negative points: firstly the blue flashing light when the unit is operating. In the dark that can be a bit distracting - I wish Plantronics had put in a feature where for instance by pushing two buttons simultaneously the light is turned off until you next turn the headphones off. You don't need the light anymore once it's been paired (and it'd save some battery power!)Secondly, and this is hardly a Plantronics fault, is the delay in the audio signal. It only shows up when watching video/TV, and causes lipsync to be lost. The delay seems to be constant, which is what you'd expect: it's caused by the buffering required by bluetooth to deal with drop-outs. I wonder if there's a way to delay the video signal by the same amount...I was worried about the cracking problems that people have reported in multiple reviews. I can see how that could happen: overally I find the unit quite sturdy (quite amazing considering how little it weighs), but the bits of plastic that supposedly crack are quite thin.But: there's only a bending force on these bits of plastic when the unit is in the desktop charger/holder, not when you're using it any other way. YOU CAN MINIMISE THIS STRESS by extending the headphone straps to maximum length. They still fit in the charger, but there's a lot less torque on them then. The other options are to only put one 'leg' in the charger, or to not use the desktop charger at all, but instead plug the charging cable directly into the headphone.If you're thinking about buying one - go for it. It's the future of headsets, and yes, in a while they'll be less expensive, but you'd miss out on this FANTASTIC wireless experience! Just make sure your phone/MP3 player supports the A2DP bluetooth stack (which gives the high-quality audio), unless you're going to use the dongle.

 review/summary: Cool product Poor quality 590A
 review/text: My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. The cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. Additionally, when speaking with Plantronics support I noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. Now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.On the positive side Plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. Plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. They are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated CS touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed

 review/summary: Nice Item
 review/text: I purchased this headset and have had it for a few days now. Overall, in stereo mode the sound quality is very nice, and the range is wonderful. I can almost walk everywhere in my house and get audio on the adapter that came with the system. If your looking for a wireless headset to use for voice communications, such as Ventilo or Teamspeak, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this one. The built in voice functionality is sub-par for VoIP communications, but excellent for phone communications. It's still an excellent headset, and wireless is a god sent, but I am still using a wired mic for best quality of sound. If you have extensive knowledge of bluetooth, I believe there is a way you can rewrite the stacks to get CD quality sound in voice communications mode. However, I use a Logitech DiNovo bluetooth desktop and it causes extensive lag in communications mode when hooked upto my existing bluetooth adapter.

 review/summary: Excellent headphones that also work with hearing aids
 review/text: I purchased the 590A a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier with it. It doesn't need the adapter to pair with my blackberry pearl. It's very comfortable, and the battery life is excellent - the phone will run out of juice before the headset does. I am on the phone most of the day, and this is the first headset I've found that I can wear and use all day without having to make constant adjustments.The other thing I really like about the headset is that I can use it with my hearing aids (ITC style) without feedback. The earpieces sit on top of the ear but not so close as to cause squealing. The volume and clarity are very good. These headphones make it much, much easier for me to use the phone, and I'm glad I bought them.

 review/text: I bought this product as a replacement for my often broken computer headsets. The battery life is great, good sound, and great microphone. The only thing I wasn't aware of is that you can't use stereo sound and voice at the same time. You can easily switch between the two with your control panel however, so its not a game stopping issue, just not the fabled PC Headset replacement we're all hoping for.

 review/summary: New user, but no major complaints - Nice Headset!
 review/text: I have only had this item for a short time, and I have not used it more than a handful of times. The sound quality is pretty good, but I'm not an audiophile. Works great with my Sony Ericsson phone as well as my Ipod. If a call comes in while I'm listening to my music, an audible alert is sounded, and a push of the side button will switch the headset to my phone. Then when the call is ended, the music switches back automatically. Nice for travel and on the plane. Only complaint so far is that the set seems like it could be built a little more durably. The flashing blue light on the right ear can be annoying if I am on the plane...I'm sure it irritates my neighbors, especially if the cabin lights are dimmed. There should be an option to turn this off on bluetooth devices in my opinion. The flashing light is a waste of battery power. Excellent battery life with this product as well.

 review/text: I bought these thinking I could use them for both Skype and my cell. Connects and works fine for cell use (although the annoying blue light flash needs to go). But this headset does NOT work for Skype and Plantronics is clear (AFTER you buy the headset, nowhere is this mentioned on the package or product listing) that Skype/VOIP is NOT supported. I'm a pretty techie guy (build my own PCs., water and phase-change cool them) and I tried everything, several BT stacks and 3 different USB and internal dongles. A one-hundred and fifty dollar stereo bluetooth headset will not work for VOIP? The cheapest mono headsets will work, but not this? Absolutely unacceptable for a higher-end headset and the shifty Plantronics people should make this clear on the packaging. I hope Amazon will change the product details to reflect this.

 review/text: Like many of you I thought this was going to be the answer to my dreams of a wireless headset. Wrong! This is made from the cheapest plastic known to mankind. My girlfriend got them for me this Christmas, and I was elated. Two weeks later cracks started to appear on the headband adjustment casing. Pow! The right side broke! So I epoxied it together. No worries! Incorrectomundo! Cracks along the left started to appear! Everybody together now! POW! The left! Epoxy to the rescue! It should be fine now.......................right!!!!! WRONG! Today the bracket which allows the earphones to swing upward broke like a pinata at a birthday party. I wish I could say I was BASE jumping or fighting ninjas when this happened, but sadly I was watching a movie trying not to disturb my lady, when the final fracture occured! The torrent of profanities pouring out of me was the opposite of what these headsets were supposed to accomplish!To conclude! Cheap plastic, Badly designed, Break easily, Will not survive ninja battle! Please Plantronics try harder next time.

 review/summary: Brilliant!! - UPDATE
 review/text: I purchased 3 sets of these over Christmas for gifts (one for myself) and I have to say they are amazing!! Sound quality is fantastic and works a treat with my bluetooth phone (and I have an obscure VK4000!! anyone heard of that model? - there you have it!!) All in all, these rock!!UPDATE: It's now the end of 2008 and these units still look and sound as good as the day I bought them and I use them nigh on constantly! No fragility problems as most of the time I just sling them in my tote. Turning the adapter on and off can be a bit of a manicure wrecker, but that is really the only flaw I have been able to find.

 review/summary: Almost as slick as advertised
 review/text: While the concept for this product is perfect, in reality audio quality is poor due to the fact that this headset requires the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), which is not widely supported at this time.I thought I would be able to use this to listen to music stored in my PowerBook G4 laptop, which I would think is a fairly common use case. To my surprise, the audio quality was no better than AM radio. It was really dissapointing. I contacted Plantronics Technical Support only to learn that I would have to use the universal adapter, which defeats the purpose of having a Bluetooth headset. Plantronics needs to disclose this issue, since so few devices currently support A2DP.

 review/summary: Works well with LG CU500
review/text: This headset works really well with the stereo music player on my phone (the LG CU500) but I find myself using it less and less simply because the headset is so clunky, and that stupid gigantic blinking blue light makes me look like a geek. I'm now in the market for a new headset that's more low-key in appearance and more stylish....

review/summary: Warning...not compatable
 review/text: Warning, Plantronics Plusar 590a headsets are not mp3 cell phone player compatible.My phone is an LG8100 and others are said to be affected. Even though the advertising states they are an "Ultimate Stereo Bluetooth Headset" and as personally stated by an online rep. "Absolutely compatible with the LG8100 cell phone", they will not work as such with my phone. Unfortunately I purchased these headphones as a solution for allowing good mp3 tunes "in stereo" while puttering around my office while at the same time being able to switch to the phone as they quote "seamlessly". Not! They will not access the mp3 player on the phone. Their support personnel wrote me this cop out note when, after purchasing, I inquired why they wouldn't work as their advertising states. "Your phone needs to support the "A2DP" profile (advanced audio distribution) in order to enable full stereo sound and streaming audio with the Pulsar headset. Most currently available phones do not yet support this profile and thus can only make sue of the headset as a mono device for phone calling, not as a media headset for music and other audio outputs." Sorry to sound so negative but to me this was a real bummer and a waste of money. It's kind of stupid running around the office wearing a full stereo headphone set just to answer mono phone calls. Be wary,Mark

 review/summary: Great Sound, Poor Design, Don't Buy...
 review/text: I received this product as a gift ordered from Amazon.com. I was pleased for the most part with the features and analog sound quality. Since the A2DP profile is not available for many devices yet, I cannot make use of the Bluetooth stereo connectivity that this phone allows. I have an LG VX8100 by Verizon, which is a great phone. I just wish I could find a great binaural bluetooth headset/headphone that works completely in stereo or at least provides a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm adapter that would allow me to listen to the mp3s on my phone through the headset. I would have been able to live with the few limitations of the device until I realized that there is a design flaw that will no doubt affect anyone who purchases this headset. I noticed a hairline fracture on one side of the headset after less than two months of careful use. The single fracture became a dual fracture on the same side and I realized I needed to return them for a replacement. I figured this was a design flaw but I liked them enough to try another pair. Lo and behold, the same thing has started to happen again.I cannot give an otherwise very good product a formidable rating when there was so little emphasis placed on the design and durability factor of a headset that costs over $100. Now I just want a refund so I can purchase a Motorola HT820 and DC800 adapter. At least it looks like Motorola thought about making a product that can be used without having to worry about it breaking on them every time they wear it.

 review/summary: Great on all fronts (so far)
 review/text: I purchased this through Amazon and recieved it the next day with free ground shipping (from Sacramento, I'm in SF) even though it was through a partner (computer brain). Seamlessly bound with my laptop (using included universal bluetooth adapter) and phone (Motorola Razr). The sound is awesome (good bass) for music and the user interface is easy for receiving/swapping to calls and back. Don't know about battery life yet, but it came fully charged which is a nice out-of-box experience. Plantronics is THE BEST in voice quality-- did some analysis for a job once. (They do NASA, Aviation, etc, so they know their stuff).

 review/summary: Plantronics needs to be more concerned about customers
 review/text: Got the headset and paired it with my new computer. Could hear just fine, but the microphone was not picking up any sound. The documentation sent with the headset was useless as was the Plantronics web site. So I called and talked to a Platronics service representative. Told the representative the problem and was told he didn't know what was wrong, end of conversation. Put the headset back in the package and sent it back. Until Plantronics gets customer service people that do more than tell you they don't know and hang up, I won't be buying again.

 review/summary: Good Wireless Headset
 review/text: I listen to my iPod all day at my desk at work, and was finally getting tired of being tied to the headphone cord. So I went shopping for wireless headphones and after a bit of research I ended up with these.I've had these for several months and they are working great. I turned the sound on the iPod as high as it would go and turn down the sound on the headphones, and that gets rid of the static sound that some people have reported. I leave the headset in the charging cradle overnight and haven't had any problems with the battery running down during the work day. If I forget to charge it then it dies a few hours into the second day. The sound quality is fine, although I admit I'm not an audiophile, and it blocks out enough ambient noise for me to be able to concentrate on my work but isn't totally sound-blocking so I can still hear when somebody says my name.The only reason I took off a star is they fit rather tightly on my head (and I'm a woman with a relatively small head) so my ears are starting to get a little sore by the end of the day. And some earrings make it impossible to wear these, although the vast majority are fine.

But it is a little strange to act as a blue light. I needed 3, because the mechanical quality is very poor.I even was once stopped, driving in my car, by a police officer, that said the use of a flasshing blue light while driving was against the law.That is the reason I am now searching for a better one, of a competitor I presume

 review/text: A couple of years ago I ordered the Pulsar Plantronics 590E set from another website and while their product description indicated I would recieve all of the accessories (the same info was used for the 590A) I didn't get them. Even without those accessories these headphones have been the best bluetooth wireless investment I've made so far. The sound quality is excellent and the controls are easy to learn. Pairing with various bluetooth enabled devices has been a breeze. The additional accessories the the 590A comes with just added icing to the cake. I'd reccomend these wireless headphones to anyone. As a matter if fact I bought this set for my fiancee to use with her Samsung Rumor and her iPod Nano and she loves them.

 review/summary: Love it, but...
review/text: Pros:-great sound in BT mode. It's actually not perfect, but you won't notice after a minute.-can connect like a regular headphone, without power, using included cable. Sound is even better than wireless.-full charge lasts a long time.-sound delay is not as bad as it seems. I velcro'd my puck to the back of a PSP and it works fine.-With some effort, you can safely pop off the foam ear pads and wash them.-Can pair with multiple devices.-stops audio if a call comes in.-comes with a USB power connector, so you don't have to carry the brick.Cons:-tight fit, but it's ok if you stretch it a few times and don't use the charging base.-the prorietary Plantronics power adapter is GARBAGE. I'm about to solder in a USB connector because their design is so flaky.-early units would occasionally fry and not charge (despite being spec'd for worldwide use). Props to Plantronics for replacing them for free.-volume controls are left/right; track controls are up/down. How does that make sense?Note:If you are new to BT profiles, you'll have to get used to the fact that there are two "profiles" in use for these devices: Headset and A/V. Headset is for phone calls, uses the mic, and is phone quality audio. A/V is for high-quality audio and does not use the mic. They are mutually exclusive profiles. This is complicated by the fact that most software implementation is hardly intuitive, so setting up can be confusing.Be sure to turn off the BT of other devices you have paired with (phone, puck, computer) when connecting with one particular device, otherwise your audio will be a wreck.

 review/text: Great toy! Sound quality is very good. Allows you to listen to music from your ipod and take a call when it comes in. Good for hands free driving which is a current issue for driver safety. As added benefit, this bluetooth adapter lets two people listen to your ipod music at the same time. With a spliter one line directly to headset and the other to adapter, the second person can listen to what is on ipod and then take calls. This works great for my wife and I when we take walks.

 review/text: When my previous head phones were damaged, I immediately asked myself "I wonder if anyone has made bluetooth head phones?" I found Plantronics and was amazed by how well they worked and how great they sound. I was most impressed with the talking feature and how the head phones would pause my music when I get a call and automatically resume at the same spot when the call ended. WONDERFUL!!I 100% recommend this product!!!

 review/summary: Not as good as I hoped
 review/text: I use Pulsar 590A just for a couple of days. I use it as stereo headphones and Skype headset for my PC (via Bluetooth 2.0 dongle) and as stereo headphones for my Pocket PC Dell Axim x50v (which has built-in Bluetooth 1.2). Setup in both cases was quite painless and quick. I also used the Bluetooth adapter that comes with the headphones, and it worked without problems.Until now I have just two serious issues with this product:1) Sound quality, in my opinion, is not satisfactory for music listening2) Flashing blue light on the right headphone - it is reflected on my PC screen when I watch movies and makes me look weird when I'm on the bus

 review/summary: Audio Lag made them unusable for me.
 review/text: As previously mentioned there is a lag of approx. .5 sec. I purchased these for use when practicing playing a guitar. Hitting a string and then hearing the sound .5 seconds later made my otherwise poor playing that much worse and made them unusable.I tried to test them as a headset with my HP bluetooth enabled notebook as well but was unable to get them to recognize each other and I finally gave up. I did not have this problem with another bluetooth headset I have.Tech. support at Plantronics was less than helpful. They insisted the lag was normal and typical of all wireless headphones.If all you need them for is to listen to music they may suffice. But consider the audio lag if you want them for any other purpose.

 review/summary: Excellent first impression
 review/text: I'm using this with a Dell D400 laptop that has built in Toshiba bluetooth (Dell Truemobile 350 module that took five minutes to install- $26 on Ebay). Setup was pretty straight forward and it seems to work great for what I wanted. Two different modes really, a stereo music mode, and a headset mode for phone use. If there's a way to have both at once, I haven't figured it out yet, as I switch back and forth. The stereo mode works great with iTunes or WMP, with the track buttons on the headset, too. I have found out in that mode the bluetooth signal is more sensitive to walls than shear range. Walking very far doesn't work if there are walls in between. The headset mode works great with Skype. I haven't tried it with a cell phone, but that's where the two modes are supposed to work simultaneously. I'm very pleased- $109 with shipping, and it's everything I wanted.

 review/summary: Serious Design Flaw.
 review/text: At first the Pulsar 590A looks and sounds very good once you get over the hefty price tag. Was unable to pair with my brandnew integrated bluetooth computer. Customer Service claims they only deal with pairing with phones and not computers and the headset is NOT suppose to be compatable with computers. mmmm makes you think. If i wanted a mobile headset only, why would i go stereo?So still using the adapter and not my integrated bluetooth, even after hours and hours of research, and reinstallations, setting changes etc.After two months i noticed small cracks in the plastic cover on the LH. Then all hell breaks lose. Small pieces start falling out and the cover just disintegrates. Today the same happened to the RH cover. The pressure from the black headband on the covers are to big for the plastic to hold out. Major design flaw imo.After talking to Customer service again, the resolve is that i send the complete unit back to the supplier in the States at my cost, and have him replace it, at which time i need to pay customs again not knowing if the replacement will last longer that three months. At which time the unit price will be in excess of $400. I think i will rather buy a new cordless top of the line headset from a different manufacturer.

 review/summary: Serious design flaw - product breaks
review/text: I've had two of these, and both have broken in the same way during the course of normal wearing and use.The way the headset adjusts for head size puts pressure on the plastic sleeve holding the midpiece in place... this plastic is thin, and eventually breaks under the stress.At that point, the sleeve can't hold the midpiece in place, and the earpiece/sleeve is able to fall freely... the only thing holding them together now is the wire that runs between each earpiece.Additionally, the end of the midpiece sticks out where the plastic sleeve used to be, and one can no longer slide it back in easily as it gets caught up instead of being held in place.This is a serious design flaw that never should have gotten through product testing. The Pulsar 590 should be remanufactured, and free replacements sent to those who purchased the flawed versions.Any class-action lawyers looking for a case?Don't buy this headset unless you want to be trying to return it in a month or two.

review/summary: Fantastic product and very useful analog adapter!
 review/text: These stereo headphones have extremely good quality sound. They are very comfortable to wear and I have worn them for up to four hours. They are extremely easy to use and connect to my LG 9400 phone. The hard case to carry them and other equipment is excellent. The item that makes this the best value by far in a stereo bluetooth headset is the analog adapter. I use this to listen to music when I am using the computer and also to listen to my ipod shuffle. I can put the analog adapter in my pocket and clip the metal shuffle on my pocket and it works pefectly. Because of the adapter, this would be the only stereo headset that I would consider buying. The only negative that I have is the flashing light on the headset. It is a little distracting, but is a minor inconvenience. I strongly recommend this product!!!

 review/summary: Exactly what it supposed to do.
 review/text: I've had my headset for almost a year now.I got it for the same price as you can get it today.....here(less than $120).I use them mainly for skateboarding, so they get put through the ringer. A fall from 12 stairs is not a good example of "careful handling", neither is the rather large quantities of sweat that they have to endure.I use them with my A2DP smartphone.I have used them with the adapter and my ipod, and I have used them wired on airplanes.The sound quality is good.The range is good.I don't have any cracks in the plastic.I don't have any charging issues, nor do I have battery life issues.My only complaints about this product are some design features.I don't like the left-right volume controls, they should be up and down.I also don't like the very large and conspicuous blue flashing light on the side. I look like a fricken moron. These headphones are supposed to make me look cool like James Bond.Minor complaints for a near perfect product.

 review/text: The cost is low ($10) and they sent it quickly. I charged the battery fully right after I received it. I didn't make any phone calls but it became low after only two days. It is worse than the one I intended to replace.For 10 dollars I don't even want to waste time to send it back. Just don't buy things from this place anymore.

 review/summary: Junk
 review/text: This headset is worthless. I too am constantly having people that I'm talking to complaining about the large amount of noise generated by this device. I cannot hear it but they can.Incoming sound is not bad, clear and fairly loud. The outgoing sound is so bad that sometimes the person on the other end of the call can't understand what you are saying which makes this product virtually unusable.Don't waste your money on this thing.

 review/summary: Good quality
 review/text: I have had this headset for over 2 months. It works well in very quiet areas but as most headsets, in loud areas it picks up ambient noise. Reception is good, but it starts to get static about 5 feet from the phone. Battery life is very good and it doesn't take long to fully charge. Overall, good product.

 review/summary: Is it worth $70?
 review/text: Pro: I charge it with the same cable as my Blackberry.Con: About 15% of the time, the other person hears an extreme/high-pitched noise that I can't hear or acknowledge.Since I use this phone for work, home, & everything in between, I have to discard this headset. For example, think about this noise happening when I host a client conference call where I'm the moderator. Then, the mess that ensues when I hang up & all others are automatically disconnected as a result.

 review/text: Now that NJ has gotten ticket happy for people who talk on their cell phones while driving, this bluetooth is a great choice. It's rechargeable, lightweight and easy to use. I don't use it that often (about once a week) so I have no idea how long the battery lasts if used on a daily basis, but since I've had it, I've only had to charge it once. Great chioce if you want an inexpensive, rechargeable bluetooth.

 review/summary: disappointed....
 review/text: This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item - I loved my 1st one. It was a great holster; I only replaced it because the elastic siding was wearing out & making my blackberry slide out much too easily. I dropped it on several occasions because it would slide out of the case. But it took it over 2 years of daily wear to get to that point - so I considered it a really good product & ordered another one. This time the price was about a third of what I had initially paid. Unfortunately - the quality is definitely sub-par. After less than 3 months, the clip feels loose & the inside covering is peeling apart in 2 places and exposing my blackberry to a gummy residue. At the price - it's not worth sending it back. I would have rather paid more & gotten a quality product like I did the first time. I can't help but wonder if this is just a lemon or is it counterfeit?

 review/text: I have had this holster for a little over a month to hold my blackberry pearl. It securely holds my phone and protects it well. The clip is more handy than I had anticipated and swivel to different degrees which is useful. It seems to be well made but the little blackberry emblem has already fallen off which makes the case look kinda ghetto. Overall, a pretty good case for the price but plan on having that small repair.

 review/summary: Blackberry Lambskin Swivel Case
review/text: I ordered this case two days after I ordered a skin from another company. A few days later expecting the skin; this case was in my mailbox. So far, I totally pleased with it. It fits perfectly. The magnet for shuting off the Pearl's screen works perfect. I guess I question is it truly produce by Blackberry (OEM) because I notice on the photos (also from RIM's website), the stitching is white and on the product I received, it's black. I just wonder if it is an OEM product; how can they sale it so cheaply? It's a $25 buck case retail. Can I live with the black stitching? Heck yes! This case appears to be well constructed, the price is awesome and VibeCelluar had it to me in days after the order. It's now 3/27 and the skin is no where to be found. Very, very happy. Is it a knock off? I hope not but I think no one would know. I'll buy another in a heartbeat!!!

 review/text: After finding that my new BlackBerry Pearl did not come with a holster, I started searching for one on Amazon. While viewing another third-party case, I saw the little blurb that showed that most people that had viewed that item bought this one instead, and now I know why. This is the perfect holster for the Pearl. It fits the device snugly, is easy to use with one hand, is well-made, and just looks sharp. It has a solidly-attached plastic spring-clamp type belt clip that has a locking-swivel to hold the case in place at any angle you prefer. All in all, this is a great product and if you're looking for a holster for your Pearl 8100, I strongly recommend this one.

They did fix the mistake, quickly sending the correct item and a return label for the incorrect item. The case itself is great; very secure.One caution, I have been keeping my Pearl in the case full time for about a week and I'm now noticing a dark spot on the screen where the magnetic closure may have affected the screen's pixels. My recommendation would be to keep the pearl in the case as little as possible (only when it's on your belt).

 review/summary: Case saves your battery
 review/text: The soft leather case contains a built in magnet, which when inserting your blackberry phone, powers down the screen, placing the phone in standby mode, without your doing anything other than placing the phone in the holster. Flap over the top of the phone also has a magnetic latch, not the strongest in the world; however, the phone will stay put even if standing on your head. Case has a swivel clip on the back, allowing adjustment in steps from vertical to horizonal (still secure). Only down side is the clip will only fit on belts up to 1-1/4" width (wider 1-1/2"+ cowboy types or thick holster width belts are too large for the clip), and the plastic can break if stepped on or laid on with enough weight. Make sure it is shipped in a box, not a pouch for that reason (it can arrive broken, but someone in shipping does have to work at it, if it's not in a pouch. First one for blackberry several years ago was almost $30,, when you can find a deal on Amazon's dealer like Unlimited Cellular, at less than $10 plus shipping it is a bargain..

 review/summary: Nice case, CHEAP belt clip
 review/text: I purchased 2 of these and they both suffered the same fate: a broken belt clip. The belt clip snapped off when I bumped the holster (bound to happen when you're wearing it on your side). The case itself is great, love that it allows the pearl to recognize that it's in the holster, but to me is worthless without a sturdier clip.For what it's worth, the seller is great it's just the product that isn't.

 review/text: I purchased a new 8110 and this case at a major electonics store; the case was $29.99 at the store. This case is exactly the same (less the retail packaging); for under $10.00 this is an excellent value. I requested standard shipping and received it within five days.All in all, a quality product and an excellent value!

 review/summary: Looks great and works great, but not long-lasting
 review/text: I am now in the process of ordering my third one of these, which is a testament to how much I like them. This case is really sleek looking and I love the fact that it automatically puts the BlackBerry into sleep mode. My first one lasted almost a year before the swivel clip broke off. My second one was ordered April 28, and here it is June 27 and the clip already broke. I told my brother about this excellent holster and he is already on his third one in 6 months.I love the functionality and style of this holster, but it seems the quality is not there in the way the clip attaches to the case. I suggest ordering at least two so you have a backup when the first one breaks.

 review/summary: OEM Swivel Case for Blackberry Pearl
 review/text: I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake. Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time, something that prior holsters have failed to do. I also like the magnetic closure, which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case, without the need for finding a snap fitting. My older Blackberries have had cases which, after use, had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the "two-handed" method for nesting my phone, one hand to move the flap out of the way, and the other to insert the phone into the case. This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the more-preferred "one-handed" approach. Although still relatively new, my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction.Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case, I looked at 3rd party generic cases. Each of these were unable to "notify" my Blackberry that it was in its holster. With my new swivel case, as soon as I insert my Pearl, the display shuts off thereby extending battery life. In addition, this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not. Also, since this is an OEM case, it was made especially for my Pearl. When holsetered, both the USB connector,the earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible. With non-OEM cases, in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone, I might have to remove the phone from its case.I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all. This is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket, unlike prior Blackberry devices. Of course, that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratch-potential. They should have at least provided a simple pouch, which would provide some protection. This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case, which is the subject of THIS review. All-in-all, I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt ... and since I'm at it, I LOVE MY PEARL.

 review/summary: Excellent case for the Pearl
 review/text: After using an OEM case that was far too large, I found this case on Amazon and just finally ordered it. Smaller web-based vendors can be iffy, but the case arrived when it was supposed to, and it was packaged very well for shipping.I was very pleased with the quality of the case, first off. The leather is soft and well-stitched. It fits the phone very snugly without making it impossible to get the phone in and out. I like the vertical style cases more than the horizontal, and the swivelling belt clip is very sturdy. The flap is easy to open with one hand, and it doesn't interfere with accessing the phone.The case also uses the magnets to put the phone into standby, which saves battery life and talk time. The design is obviously for the Pearl, as it leaves all the important jacks and ports accessible while the phone is still in the case.You can't go wrong with this case if you need a basic, well-crafted, good quality case.

 review/summary: Takes advantage of the Bb auto-off feature
 review/text: One drawback of any soap-bar, or candy-bar style phone is that you have to lock the keyboard with some button combination every time you put it away or it will dial the last person you called, or someone on speed-dial when you inadvertently push one of it's keys. This holster has magnets in it that automatically puts the Pearl in standby mode, which disables the keys. The belt-clip also allows you to rotate the holster into the most comfortable position you can for driving, or walking around.

 review/text: This is a nice holder but it does break if your not careful. I just ordered my 3rd one because they seem to break easy when getting into my truck, this could be avoided if you swivel the phone before you enter a car seat. This is not a faulty design just the end user being lazy and not being careful getting in and out of a vehicle.

 review/text: Not worth the money. Under normal use, wearing it on my belt :-) duh, it broke in less than a month. The plastic pin that allows you to swivel the holster is the weak link. The case itself is great, soft leather but the cheap plastic swivel design is poor. Go buy a Blackberry Silicone Skin case instead to protect the blackberry and then pick up an after market cheap holster at Wal Mart and you'll be much happier..

 review/text: I really wanted to get something to protect my BB Pearl and did a bit of searching to find just what I wanted. I normally put my phones in my pocket which invariably leads to accidental phone calls or a ton of pictures of the inside of my pants pocket. Well no more! This holster is one of the neatest cell doo-dads I've found in quite a while. Very slick how it locks the keypad and puts the phone in to a sleep mode automatically. Plus the lambskin is nice and soft. Got a Pearl? Get this.

 review/text: This is a great cell phone holster. I use it with generic flip phones. This holster supports cell phones that are approximately 2 inches wide and up to 4 inches tall. The holster has panels that stretch making it easy to adapt to most phones.FYI, I ordered this unit from WebTreo. They sent me a wider version which was 2.5 inches wide. It was a lot of hassle getting hold of the seller to get the exchange made. Two weeks later I received the correct unit.

 review/text: this case is really tight ( for my pearl 8100) and bulky. I switched back to the original case i got with the phone. The material on the sides (rough PE) is abrasive enough that it leaves fine lines on the phone when you pull the phone in and out of this case. Don't be too dazzled by the leather on the front and back like the other users.

 review/text: This case is very nice looking and well built. The magnet closure is strong so the strap closes itself with just a slight flick. The case is sized accurately so it fits snug without making it difficult to insert or remove the phone. It has the magnet mechanism that puts your phone in standby when you start to put it into the case. You never have to worry about locking the keys or accidentally calling someone when you insert or remove the phone. Very cool feature that handles one of the main issues with any phone case.The ratchet on the swivel mechanism seems more stable than most, and I have never had the case twist out of the position I set. The clip is plenty stiff to hold most anywhere and I never worry that it will come off. The leather is very soft and the interior is very kind to the scratch-prone shell of my red Pearl.

I got it for my blackberry but I realized that my Blackberry is micro-usb and not mini-usb.There is not detailed information in the Amazon's page and the unique picture is so bad in terms of quality that you cannot see the type of connector.No happy with my purchase :(

 review/text: I had been buying chargers for my LG phone that were bargain versions not made or endorsed by LG. I had two fail within a relatively short time. Decided to buy this LG product, and am very happy with it--a well-made, durable product, much sturdier than the knock-offs, and working perfectly so far. Well worth the small additional cost overall.

 review/text: This carrier for cell phones offers many carrying options (wristlet, belt, bag) and is reasonably priced. It was nicely constructed and serves the purpose for which it was intended very well. The only thing I might have added was a snap (it would need to be a little bit longer to accomodate a snap) to close it shut (it is an open design), so the cell phone couldn't fall out of the carrier. Since I have it attached to the inside of my bag, this is generally not a problem, but for those who carry it on a belt or wrist, etc., it might be.

 review/summary: Don't get this case!
 review/text: I want to be really fair, Krusell makes very high quality cases, but this phone is just a pain to make case for.This Krusell case fits very well, however, because the BB has microphone underneath the key pads the plastic cover on this case will make you sound very muffled and weak. This phone doesn't have a "microphone opening" like other phones, so the only way to expose the mic is not to have a case. I have received complaints from customers and coworkers that I sound horrible. The thickness of the case makes it very difficult to use the thumbwheel. Overall, this case will degrade the functionality of the phone.

 review/text: The Krusell Classic Multidatp case for Blackberry 7130e looks good. However, it is seriously lacking in what is the most important feature - access to the trackwheel. The cutout which allows access to the trackwheel is entirely too small - and I am a female with very small fingers. I plan to return this case and instead invest in screen guards and carrying case.

 review/summary: four year old phone, Brand NEW Battery, whats an early adopter?
 review/text: I have a motto to live by Reduce Reuse Repair Recycle. Since most Americans get a new cellphone every six months to a year, the carrier(It starts with a V} sells you a phone with a battery that will last you two years tops. After two years they stop carrying replacement batteries so they can force you(their loyal customer) to buy another crumby phone that costs the CARRIER maybe $50 bucks tops so that they can lock you into another contract with a termination fee for the full MSRP; lets say 200 dollars. This act of forcing one to buy a new phone every one to two years is fueling a war in central Africa where rare metals like Coltan and Germanium are mined. In 2010 a BILLION new cellphones will be manufactured with over 200 million of those destined for the USA. If you would like to help end Wars for Resources buy a replacement battery, keep using that old cellphone, and demand that your carrier give you a discount for preventing bloodshed. I would like to thank this battery manufacture for saving the life of a nameless/faceless child soldier.

 review/summary: Batteries Not Fresh?
 review/text: I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly.

review/text: As title.If you are using AT&amp;T service, it's likely your phone is T720 instead of T720i. One way to check this is to see whether you can find &quot;Picture Msg&quot; in your menu or not. If not, then there is no way for you to use this attachment.

 review/summary: I like it
 review/text: Technically its not really a charger since theres not much in the way of built in electronics and the actual power adapter isnt included. Compatable with most of the newer Motorola phones, it has a plug that snaps in when you dock the phone and has the same port comming out the back of the charger. You can plug in the A/C charger that comes with the phone or a USB data cable if you have one that goes to your computer (for address books, etc), the port on the back is a complete duplicate of the one on your phone.I've used it on the Motorola T720/730 as well as the V710 that just came out, though its not listed in the description. There is also an slot in the back to charge a separate battery at the same time. The clock on the front is battery powered like a standard wristwatch and does not use the power from the cable, not sure what the reasoning is on this, maybe they meant for it to be something that was intended to be more portable.I did have one other charger for this same phone that was a cheaper generic version. It was horrible compared to this Motorola one. The phone was hard to seat and overall it was pretty ugly. So having had the far cheaper and uglier version, I appreciated this one much more.

 review/summary: Why bother?
 review/text: Please note this comes without an AC adapter. So all you're getting is a plastic thing to sit on your desk. The stooooopid clock isn't even powered by the AC adapter (yours, came with the phone or purchased separately.) I acually use mine just to hold the end of my charger on my desk at work. When I want to charge my phone, I unplug the AC connection from the back and plug it straight into my phone. Saves me from digging around under my desk at least.You're better off just buying an extra AC adapter and some tape.

Comes nicely packaged in a reclosable container that can store the stock case. Amazon packes it in with air filled pouches. ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT A 5 star. However, becasue of the wrong color, it goes down to a 4 star.

 review/summary: Sleek design, allows you to multitask, best thing next to wireless!
 review/text: I've been using Nokia cell phones for years and this is the first time I've ever used a headset. The model of my phone (6010) doesn't have a lot of variety as far as headsets go, so I was a bit worried about what I was going to get.Most of my friends have the kind of headset that has the microphone that hangs down at their mouths... which I've always personally never liked... it looked awkward and just not very nice to look at. But one of the first things that appealed to me about this Boom Headset is its sleek design. The microphone and ear piece are connected in a small, discrete, black unit that is hidden on whichever side of your face you use it on.Another element that I love about my headset is this small button it has hidden on the earpiece to answer and hang up when you have a call. I find this most helpful when I'm driving. Before I take off, I place the headset on my ear and leave my phone in the cup holder. When I get a call, instead of having to reach down and search for my phone's answer button, I can keep my eyes on the road, reach up to my ear, click a button and I'm talking! Then when I have to hang up, I press the button again and I'm disconnected like that!Having this headset is great for when I have to use the phone and do other things. It lets me multitask! And this may not seem like that big of a deal, but being able to do other things without having to balance your phone between your shoulder and head is really great. I can use the computer, cook, walk around the house, all at ease with my headset!Since my phone doesn't support Bluetooth, I have to settle for a wired headset but I have to say... this is the next best thing to wireless as far as headsets go. I've asked all my friends about the quality of how I sound and they say it's great: good volume, no static, and no interference.It looks nice, is sold at a great price on Amazon (a bit more pricey on Nokia's website), and does what it's supposed to do. This product is highly recommended!

 review/summary: Works only on Nokias (sometimes)... and never on other brands.
 review/text: Nokia phones, as a rule, do not work with 'standard' plug accessories. Even though after-market manufacturers frequently advertise that their headsets and other appliances are compliant with most Nokia models - most are not. If you look closely at the plug on most 'universal' plug in appliances, you will see TWO narrow black rings around the metal pole that is the plug. On Nokia, plugs with THREE bands are required and, generally speaking, these are made by and available from ONLY Nokia. Most/all after market brands are the 'universal type' and have the correct width plug, but with only the two bands - and these things just don't work with Nokias - I have purchased and returned enough of them to know this as a fact.To further complicate the situation, all Nokia accessories do not work correctly on all Nokia phones - even the same model phone will sometimes accept a particular accessories and sometimes not. This Headset is one such device. Because we only want phones, not cameras, video machines, internet access or voice mail - my wife and I use Nokia's simplest GSM phone, the 6010. We actually have three of them in the family. We bought three of these headsets and found that it works perfectly on one of them, intermittently on the second and not at all on the third. All three phones are identical, were purchased at the same time and work perfectly.I infer from this experience two things. 1) The Nokia brand makes it's adapters differently enough so that no after-market (less expensive) brands that you might buy for use on most other cell phones will work on Nokias (smart manufacturing integration, I suppose - but not especially customer friendly), and 2) that even with their own branded accessories, their functionality is inconsistent.Nokia makes good phones - but owning one locks you in to using their own accessories - some of which work quite well, some intermittently and others not at all. Let the buyer beware - or be prepared to spend the time, effort and cost of returning things. I wouldn't buy a Nokia again if only for this reason.

review/text: The product description on Amazon's web page indicates that this headset is compatible with the Nokia 2600 phone. So I ordered two of them together, but neither one worked with my Nokia 2600. Since the seller would only refund my purchase price and original shipping charges, I had to pay the return shipping costs myself. So I'm now back to square one with no headset for my phone -- and with less money in the bank than before. The only reason I'm giving this headset one star is because I wasn't able to proceed with my review unless I rated it at least one star!

 review/summary: The Boom Headset (HDB-5) does NOT work for the Nokia 2600
 review/text: I researched and ordered the Nokia Boom Headset (HDB-5) for the Nokia 2600, which was suppose to work for the Nokia 2600. Upon receiving it I was very disappointed because when I would plug it into my Nokia 2600 it kept coming up with the message 'enhancement not supported'. I tried everything to get it to work (including taking it over to my cell phone store and asking them if I was doing something wrong). They couldn't even come up with an answer. You need to take the Boom Headset (HDB-5) off of the list of enhancements for the Nokia 2600, because it does not work for that model. As you can see it gets a very low rating from me, since it didn't work for my cell phone. Your list of enhancements is very misleading and right now I have no hands off device for my Nokia 2600 because of your misleading list.

 review/text: Beware of aftermarket and imitation car chargers, as they can cause damage to your phone and possibly damage to your car. There have been cases were phones have caught fire because the phone was using aftermarket batteries and/or aftermarket chargers.I was initially misled by the prices of the really cheap aftermarket chargers. The first one I got was defective, so I got another one which caused interference with my car's electronics system. The speakers would make weird popping sounds. And even then, sometimes the phone wouldn't charge. When I replaced it with the genuine Nokia charger that I bought from Amazon.com, everything was perfect. The phone charged properly and the pops from the sound system were gone. Don't be misled by the prices of aftermarket goods, they can cause damage to your phone and your car.Amazon.com is selling the real deal, a genuine Nokia &quot;enhancement&quot; for an absolutely bargain price. Get it now, you will never find a better deal on a genuine Nokia product.

 review/summary: Does not work on most Nokia's
 review/text: My experience with this accessory is making dislike the Nokia brand even more. Why can't they just make an earpiece that works on ALL Nokia phones? But no, that would be too easy and customers would not be forced to buy new accessories when they upgrade their phones. Anyhow, I did an Amazon search for my phone model and this one was the first to pop up on the list when sorted by relevance, so I assumed it would work on my phone. What a stupid mistake. Maybe I should have done more due diligence and read the whole description list, but when something not compatible pops up FIRST that is deceiving.

 review/text: Just like the originals I had years ago when I got the phone. Very satisfied and quick delivery. I originally bought three then bought four more. I have a bad habbit of stepping on the earpiece and ruining them. Now, they are so reasonably priced I don't get upset about ruining them anymore. I just grab the next set. Way better than microwaves up side your head. Worth every penny.

 review/summary: Hands free headset works fine
 review/text: This little headset works great on my ancient phone. I am happy to be able to find it online at a reasonable price. When this was the current technology, it went for a lot more money. Only issue is that it needs to be replaced once or twice a year because the connection tends to weaken over time.

 review/text: Nice case, I bought it mostly so the phone won't fly apart when I drop it. The case covers the power button for the phone, but the power button still works fine through the case.I have a charging stand to hold my phone upright while it's charging. The case has a cutout for the charging socket, but because of the thickness of the leather, the phone doesn't connect with the charger. You can still use the travel charger, but to use the desktop charger I'd need to take the case off.

 review/text: I used this together with a Nokia 6600 and it worked well communication-wise however it is a little bulky and can get a little uncomfortable if worn for too long. I had no real problem with the ear pieces which are quite sturdy and they have an extra one included as well. Given the wireless headsets that are currently out there which are smaller and more comfortable I'm not sure if these will be popular for long though.However, this particular one works as advertised and perfectly with my Nokia 6600.

 review/summary: Cool features but uncomfortable
 review/text: This headset integrates seamlessly - took a whole 30 seconds to set up pairing (that's Bluetooth technobabble) and get it up and running. However, the design may look cool, but unless it's worn just "so" it's actually painful to wear. There's no padding on the over-the-ear plastic loop, or on the hard plastic earset. To really hear well, you need to press it up against the ear - and this does not feel good. It causes the ear loop to pull at the ear, and the plastic earset to smash up against your ear. If you're in a quite environment, it's great - but if your car windows are open or A/C is on high, you'll have a hard time hearing.I tried to use it in the gym - forget it. I had to cup my hand over my ear and press the headset against my ear.I like the Jabra's ergonomics better - it's really comfortable - but gave up getting it to work after 45 minutes of trying. It would pair, but would NOT communicate. I returned the Jabra and ordered the Nokia. I'll keep the Nokia - it works flawlessly.

 review/text: Amazon dosen't carry a picture of this case on their website but search for nokia ctu-24 in google to see the picture at other websites, I knew what I was getting, hence I am not dissapointed . Why 4 stars you say? There should have been an opening to charge the 3650 while in this case, there isin't...what was nokia thinking?...but other than this the case is well made and the inner lining of the case is soft so no scratches on the phone's LCD. Of course like the other reviewers have said - you can't make or receive calls when the phone is in this case. Well the other cases cost 25+shipping and this one's 12.99...so it's a compromise..

 review/summary: Great case if you wear pants
 review/text: This is really a great case. It seems to be high quality leather. The stitching is solid and even all the way around. It is a horizontal case with a strong belt hook. I've worn it for a couple of days now and I hardly notice it is on my belt. My Nokia 3650 phone fits snug inside against the soft, velvety insides, giving the phone a smart, soft, scratch-free compartment. The case closes with a good velcro flap. The Nokia silver and black label adorns the front flap.A previous reviewer didn't like the case due to the fact that you have to take the phone out of the case to use it. This is true, however, if you wear pants a lot, you can quickly open and remove the phone from the case. This case is $25 at the Nokia Web site (as of 10/2003), so the price (12.99) here is great! I highly recommend this case!

 review/summary: good battery
 review/text: Before buying, I had read the reviews and was concerned about the battery's quality and ability to hold a charge. The shipped battery had just one bar showing. I plugged it in to charge overnight, but the next day, saw it was still at one bar. I was about to return it and contacted the company for RMA, which they sent immediately.Before I got around to mailing it back, I tried recharging the battery in a different outlet, and it charged fine. User error: my power strip was defective (likely damaged after a recent power outage); the battery is perfectly good.Important: I followed the recommended procedure for charging new batteries. I charged it fully and then let it discharge fully, past the "low battery" warning until it had no juice at all. I ran it through this complete cycle twice. The battery has been performing fine. I get several days on standby and more than enough talk time. (I am NOT a heavy cell phone user.)

 review/summary: Hard to find ...
 review/text: For those of us who haven't moved on to smart phones, who don't want to pay extra every month so anyone with too much time on their hands can email us while we're driving down the highway and we'll instantly know it and feel compelled to respond ("Sent from my ...", aaaarrgghh); for those of us who still like the relative simplicity of our ancient Nokia flipper, replacement batteries are getting harder and harder to find. My five year old Nokia was dying on a full charge, found this replacement at Amazon, arrived two days after ordered, overnight charge, and my phone is working like new again. I gave this battery 5 stars, but if there were extra stars available I would give Amazon and HollyCellular a few extra stars for looking after us (relative) old goats who prefer to keep our lives sane and simple.

 review/text: I received this battery in good time with prompt shipping. Unfortunately, it was worse than the battery I was replacing. I got approximately 4 to 6 hours of life on standby primarily! I asked if this was refurbished or with an old manufacture date and was told it was new with a 2009 manufacture date.The company was responsive and professional and promptly sent me another battery. The replacement was just as bad as the first. I received a refund without a problem. I ordered this battery through another company as well and received another piece of junk too!Unfortunately, I have to use another phone since I can't find a good battery.

 review/text: Yeah, we all know how expensive replacing batteries are. Gads!! However we got this Nokia replacement and it was very resonably priced and works just as well as all those other higher priced batteries. Good value for your money.

 review/text: I thought buying OEM would be better than one of the clones. This battery isn't any better than the original battery that came with my phone 2 years ago. I don't use my phone much, but I'm having to recharge this battery every other day. I didn't make a good choice on this one.

 review/text: If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more. I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like! The phone now works like new!

 review/text: this is the second time that i have ordered this battery for my ancient nokia phone. i was thrilled to find it and also that i could purchase 3 for less then half the price of the one i purchased previously. i love my phone and want to keep using it for another 10 years. now i have all the batteries i need ..when i recieved these..{long transit time} the charge was not even showing and i was in fear that it would not charge. but after 3 or 4 min. a tiny beep and then it charged. {all 3 of them} it took only about 4 to 5 hours for a full charge, but i left in the other 2 over night. i am using one now in my phone to test the hold of charge. so far, its working great.. been several days of constantly being on and so far its great.

 review/summary: Great features in a small form factor
 review/text: I purchased the S710 a few weeks ago and I have been very happy with it so far. I had previously been using a Sony Ericsson W810i which was a great phone for personal use and as an MP3 player, but I needed a smartphone for work. I didn't want something as large as a Blackberry and wanted to avoid a touchscreen and stylus. The S710 was the perfect compromise.I've never used a smartphone or Windows Mobile before so I can't say if WM6 is any improvement. I was surprised to find while editing my contacts that there is no copy and paste function. I was able to find an add on application but it seems a rather strange thing not to include in a smartphone. The S710 comes with HTC's homescreen and green color scheme which is a color that most closely resembles vomit. This can be removed using a debranding app. On such a beautiful looking device it's a shame that HTC chose such a nauseating interface.And this is a beautiful phone. The all chrome face is a bit much for my taste, but isn't as prone to fingerprints as I expected and it contrasts nicely with the matte keys and the flat black. The sides and back are rubberized plastic which feels soft but durable in your hand. The QVGA screen is clear and bright even in sunlight.The phone feels solid and rugged and is surprisingly heavy for it's size. But considering all that's packed into so small a space and the long battery life it's an extra weight I can handle. The slide out keyboard doesn't lock when closed and has a slight wiggle. It hasn't opened accidentally but it's a strange contrast to an otherwise sturdy phone. The keys on the keyboard are small but nicely spaced and give good tactile response. But if you have large primate hands, this is not the phone for you.The earpiece is loud, which is great for talking on NYC streets, but has noticeable distortion. It bothered me at first since my old Sony Ericsson was so clear but I have gotten used to it now. The vibrate mode is rather weak, and I don't always feel it vibrate especially when I am walking.The lack of 3G doesn't bother me since I mainly use the data connection for email which EDGE is fine for. The smaller sized screen isn't that great for viewing web pages anyway. WiFi works well and connects to my home access point faster than my laptop. AT&T; made a surprising effort at helping me get it set up for data but ultimately I had to find the configuration posted in a forum and enter it manually.PROS:Keypad, QWERTY keyboard, smartphone in a small package; I haven't found any other phone like it.CONS:Keyboard wiggleSound distortion

 review/summary: All in one package!
 review/text: I have had this phone for about 1-1/2 months thus far, and I am extremely pleased with everything it has to offer. I purchased this phone because I do a lot of travelling in my life, and have no office. Even though I have a laptop with me at all times, it is much more convenient to be able to deal with small matters via the phone. I wanted a device that makes clear calls, can roam anywhere in the world if necessary, allows me to Skype (so I don't have to pay any ginormas roaming charges), gives me ultimate connectivity for e-mails and internet, is easy and comfortable enough to use to send e-mails (QWERTY keyboard was a must), and could manage Office documents. I achieved what I wanted.I'll gloss over the obvious specs, and speak more about the details only discoverable while using.Calls: Call quality is one of the best features of this phone. All calls, regardless of where I am in the world, are received clear and crisp. The Quad-band ensures you can get onto any network as well.The contacts ability on the phone is phenomenal. The amount of personal information you can store for each contact is rediculous. However, it works out very handy if you do take the time to enter in most of it - you just need to click on the contact name, and all your options come up - for instance, if I call John on his cell and he doesn't answer, I just click on his name again, and scroll to his work number and send. No answer again, then do the same except scroll to the home number. Still no success? Try sending IM - messenger will sign in and check if John is online. STILL can't find him? Click and scroll to "Text" him, or even "send e-mail". It saves a lot of hassle of having to go into each task individually, like going into text message to text, then opening up e-mail to send e-mail, opening and signing in messenger to send an IM, etc.There are a variety of home screens you can choose from, the one I have as my default gives me everything I need to know at a glance - tells me if I have e-mail, SMS, MSN messenger messages, WiFi, time, date, profile, appointments. You can get all the information you need to see if you need to check anything on the phone without having to unlock it. It also has a convenient "most recently used applications" row.Connectivity: WiFi and GPRS/EDGE works extremely well, no issues at all. Using the phone as a modem is also extremely useful in non-WiFi areas, and is very simple to pair with the computer, via mini USB or Bluetooth.I installed Skype Mobile on it, works without issue. There is some delay in the voice transfer, and there is an echo (even with the echo cancellation on), but it serves it's purpose. I don't know if the 201MHz processor is the cause of it, as I was worried about the performance of Skype without a 400MHz processor.The version to install off the website is the smartphone version (obviously), but is labelled for the HTC S620 - this is the one to download for the HTC S710.Bluetooth works well, and ensures security with security PIN's for each connection.E-mail and internet: Multiple accounts can be set up, I'm not even sure how many. You can choose the frequency to download e-mails, or just select to do it manually. Occassionally the sync may fail, even after repeating the attempt - what has always worked for me is just powering down and back up again.Internet works fine, no need to mention anymore on that.Typing is great, as the phone remembers what you've previously typed better than any other I have ever come across. Texting or typing e-mails is a cinch, even wiith the number pad. Every letter you type in a word narrows down what the word can be - the options are all shown at the bottom of the screen. This works out great for me when sending formal e-mails - any long words can be inserted after just typing 2-3 letters - very convenient.Phone build: Very sturdy design, nothing feels flimsy or weak. The size of the phone is fantastic, it is actually smaller than the Blackberry Pearl on the height and width, but slightly thicker. The slide out keyboard feels solid and sturdy, and the keys are designed well, concaving up to make it easy to press without much mistakes. The screen takes a couple of seconds to flip from potrait to landscape, which I have seen a lot of people swear against the phone as a result. But to be honest with yourself, how much is that really hurting you?The screen is bright and very clear. In very bright sunlight, it isn't perfect, but it still shows up well enough to make out everything you need without problem.Office Mobile 6.0: Works good, no problems so far. The really great part about this is that the files all keep their original formatting. A point to note though is that you cannot create new files. Simple enough solution - just transfer a blank document to the phone for each application, and use as the template. If you wish to create a file, just open and use the "Save As" function.The is no ZIP function, so any zipped files won't be able to be unzipped.Camera: I won't say much on this, since I personally have never really cared for a camera on a phone.All the details on the file explorer, media player, camera, etc are as per spec, so I won't waste time commenting on that.Basically, this is a truely great phone and I am extremely happy with it thus far. My advice to anyone looking to purchase this - you may want to compare with the HTC TyTN II (Kaiser) which I believe has just been released. Not for te tilt screen - that is non-functional in my opinion (just try seeing if you would ever need to tilt the screen when typing on a little phone, as opposed to a large laptop - rediculous!). However, the notable advantages of the Kaiser are 3G, HSPDA, HSUDA, GPS, 128M RAM, 256M ROM. It may be better suited for your daily activity.Call me old fashioned, but I prefer to stay away from touch screen devices - it just seems to me that they beg to be dropped, and get dirty and damaged. I would still pick this model over the Kaiser, because it suits my needs perfectly, and while I wish it had the expanded connectivity, it is still more than sufficient.Buy this phone, you will not regret it.

 review/summary: Best phone I've ever had!
 review/text: I've had this phone for over a year and I love it! It's not without its faults, but overall you can't beat it. Here are some of the things I'm not crazy about:> No 2.5mm headphone jack, just the USB> Sometimes a little slow/glitchy, but not bad.> Only one, not very smart, alarm clock. This one is probably a small issue for most people, but I use my phone as an alarm clock a lot and it basically treats it like an appointment, so snooze options are really funky and I can't choose the tone. There's probably a program or something I could install, but it would have been nice to not have to mess with.> The keyboard buttons are small, but I can navigate and type still with only a few errors. (I'm a guy with slender fingers, so someone with thicker fingers would probably have more of an issue.)Otherwise, this is a great phone, but only for the casual user. I don't think business users would have tolerance for some of the features it lacks and for the money, you could get something more suited to your needs. But someone wanting a phone that's nicer than just a run-of-mill freebie from your provider, but not a full on, business intensive PDA/phone, then this is for you.Call quality in any mode (handset, speaker, headset) is perfect, features are really good (Word, Excel, Adobe reader, etc.), Windows Media Player, etc.Basically, I'm only shopping again because the kids got mine wet and it shorted out. It still works, but the battery life, which was amazing before (2-3 days of moderate use without charging), isn't what it used to be. I'll be trying to either fix my phone or replace it, but not changing models unless I really have too.

 review/text: I have had at least 10 different types of Smartphones. I have been using this phone for about 6 months and it is without question the best. The only negative--if you use the screen a lot, the battery life is not as strong as I would like. Every phone I have tried has this same problem.

 review/summary: please don't buy this phone
 review/text: I just realized that I have the S710 not the S710 VOX. Everything else remains the same.I have never written a review but I hate this phone so much I had to write it, I take care of my electronics and I am so angry that I have this phone. I bought this phone about 5 months ago. Let me list the reasons why this phone is the worst tech investment ever:1. Sometimes my mail downloads, sometimes not.2. When it does download, sometimes the whole message downloads, sometimes it downloads partially although my settings are for the full message.3. And now i am getting an error message about low storage space that pops up every few minutes even though i have deleted almost everything on the phone.4. This phone is a POWER HOG! One minute its fully charged, the next hours, maybe not even a whole day it's dead. And I have power saving settings on.5. If you enter 3 numbers for the same contact, the name shows up 3 times, not just once w/ 3 numbers connected to it.6. I e-mailed HTC tech help DAYS ago about the memory alert and I have not gotten any response yet.AND I know someone else who got a touchscreen HTC at the same time that I got this phone. His touch screen already has stopped working. And he also takes care of his phone.I just want to trash this phone with a bat but it costs $400.00! Although this phone has nice features, it is not easy to use and for the hassle that it is, it's not worth the money. HTC is not ready for prime time! Instead, get a blackberry, an i-phone, get a wire and two cups... anything else but an HTC. Or you'll be very sorry.

 review/summary: Awesome looking phone, quality appears great.. shiny, but its more like bronze than gold
review/text: This phone seemed soooooo awesome out of the box! It looks bodacious! It feels like high quality. You turn it on and its easy to use, sounds good, and has a great speakerphone.But here are a couple problems I had with the phone...Poor reception! About 3 or 4 times in the first 2 weeks of owning this phone, my reception would cut out for hours at a time no matter where I was in town.ALARM PROBLEMS!!! I set an alarm for everyday when I wake up. Well I switched shifts so I disable the alarm on the phone... but it still wouldn't shut off!!! Every day it went off at the same time no matter how many times I deleted the alarm! and if the phone is locked it's very hard to shut the alarm off before you want to throw the phone against the wall.... Also it would activate the alarm about 50 times in the same moment, causing the device to freeze and no way to reset it, unless you take the battery out. WHICH CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING when you're trying to sleep in.I have read in online posts that this has happens to lots of S710 owners.Everything else is great! good wi-fi, calls, etc.

I recommended if you need a small and powerful tools on the road.

 review/text: THE S710 IS A FAIRLY GOOD PHONE.MY MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE IS THAT THE PROCESSOR IS SO DAM SLOW.WHEN U OPEN THE PHONE IT TAKES 3 SECONDS FOR THE SCREEN TO GO FROM VERTICAL TO HORIZONTAL. THE PHONE HAS SOME MINOR GLITCHES EVERY NOW(I DONT KNOW A SMART PHONE THAT DOSENT) AND THEN BUT NOTHING BIG.I DONT LIKE THE WAY THE PAGES ARE DISPLAYED WHEN USING WIFI BUT IT DOES WORK.THE BATTERY LAST LONG AND CHARGES QUICKLY.THE SIGNAL IS ALLWAYS GREAT THE HOME SCREEN IS ADJUSTABLE BUT TO A POINT.I DONT KNOW IF HTC HAS DOWNLOADABLE THEMES AT THEIR WEBSITE.THE WORD PROGRAMS WORK WELL BUT THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE I TRANSFERED A DOCUMENT (PAY SPREAD SHEET) FROM A JAZJAM TO MY PHONE.IT WORKED BUT PART OF IT WAS MISING. AS FOR THE PLAYERS I DONT KNOW IF IT PLAYES MP4'S BUT EVERY FILE I PUT ON THERE PLAYS FINE THE EAR BUDS SUCK BUT YOU CAN BUY AN ADAPTER THAT HAS AN STANDARD PORT.THE MEDIA PLAYER WORKS GREAT AND IN FULL SCREEN.THE COOLEST FEATURE IT HAS IS THE ABLITY TO MAKE YOUR OWN RING TONES.YOU CAN TAKE A MUSIC FILE AND TRIM IT FOR WICH PORTION OF THE SONG YOU WANT.THE CAMERA HAS A LOT OF FEATURES BUT IT'S STILL A 2 MP CAMERA.THE SOUND IS GREAT THE EAR SPEAKER AND REAR SPEAKER ARE LOUD AND CLEAR.I DONT HAVE A BLUE TOOTH SO I CANT COMMENT ON THAT.ITS ALSO GREAT THAT YOU CAN BE ON A CALL AND NAVIGATE THE OTHER FEATURES OF THE PHONE LIKE CHECK YOUR TEXT MESSAGES WRITE A DOCUMENT ECT.

I don't know what that one guy is complaining about with the magnets (the review may have been for the black one, I bought both). They are quite strong. No manner of violent shaking will release the phone (I tried very hard!). I would feel comfortable taking it on my motorcycle. It is also BIGGER than it looks in the picture. This added biggness isn't just waste though. It is thicker in everywhere the phone is likely to get whomped. Seeing it in person, I would have payed 15-20 bucks for it. It beats any of the stuff motorola makes for the razr. Stylish too.

 review/text: I've been using this case for about two months now. The materials could be a bit better but I've had no significant problems. I very much like the slim profile and for the price, I'd rather have a couple of these than a more expensive type of case. A problem I had with other cases was how far off the belt they hung which this solves nicely by really hugging your belt. The tan is definitely darker than shown. Decent case for the money in my opinion. Pro is it's slim profile and firm belt clip. Con is that the materials could be better.

That second shipment never arrived. The first one did, finally, a couple of weeks later (I know it was the first one because of an ID number on the shipping label supplied by Webtreo after my original order). However, it was the wrong battery. The shipping list in the package had the right battery listed, but the battery did not fit my phone and information on the battery itself identified it as a different battery. Webtreo never responded to my email about sending the wrong battery. Amazon, however, did refund my money.

 review/text: My N400 phone must be a newer revised edition over the early ones, because I have nothing but great things to say about it. On the PCS network, the standard battery is OK for normal talking, but if you use analog roaming, or talk several hours a day without a charger plugged in, then this is the battery for you. It is about twice as thick and weighs twice as much as the feather weight stock battery. Even then, the phone weighs only slightly more than the old N200 with a stock battery. It also gives you a better grip, and provides you with plenty of yak time.If you like to surf, or just like to talk, this is a worthwhile expense.

review/text: Received this belt clip today after a 6 week wait (ordered on August 4th). It finally shows up today, and it's not the right one for use with a Siemens S56!!!The box says it's compatible with the L56 series and also the M46 and S46.The Siemens part number for this item IS L36880-N5601-A125, just as Amazon indicates. However, it's NOT compatible with the S56!!Basically, if you look at your S56, you'll see the two little holes on the sides where the clip is supposed to attach. The "arms" of this belt clip are way too long. They were meant to reach around the sides of the phone to little holes on the front half of a phone, not the back half where the mounting holes are on the S56.If you've ordered this for the S56 and waited as long as I have, you're in for a disappointment. Shipping this one back to Amazon tomorrow...

 review/text: From Tina, not Mark (hey y'all, this review is for a totally chick item! My husband wears cammo when he hunts, not printed on a cute little "accessory case" to hang his phone around his neck!):This case is a welcome addition to my darling wardrobe of about five Kangaroo "fashion statement" cell phone cases in which I can carry my little Motorola flip phone, even when I don't have my purse, or a handy pocket.I've received LOTS of compliments on this cool cammo one (I live in rural Arizona, which is crawling with cammo-garbed hunters - turkey, deer, elk, rattlesnake... yum! - and this fits right in with everyone's hunting garb. It even matches the cool cammo-trimmed nylon shirt my darling Mark bought me at Wal-Mart in the hunting section!)If you have a smart phone, it probably won't fit. However, I don't have a "smart phone" because I don't want one. I don't text, because: a) I'm an unabashed Luddite; b) I'm an English teacher, and I can't stand to read "textese," with all the punctuation, capitalization, spelling and general language abominations, and c) I don't want to shuffle around with glazed eyes like a zombie, shoulders hunched, with my thumbs working to text some illiterate message, ignoring people walking towards me, tripping over curbs, and running into walls or whatever, maybe even drooling... you avid, zone-out texters are really missing out on real life.Stand up straight, look me in the eyes, smile, and dial my number for a live chat, for heaven's sake!This little gem is well-made (I bought a couple of cases from another company, and they frayed and disintegrated in about 6 months - Kangaroos are tough... I still have the ones I bought about 6 years ago, and they're fine, even after they're handwashed (the neck strap can get a mite grimy.) I even wear the non-washable gold lamme one when I dress up!Highly recommended to any woman out there who has a basic phone, and wants to keep it handy. I can always find my phone, no matter where I go, and never have to fumble for it in pocket or puse.

For an active person (I am in the IT department of my company) this case comes off way to easily. The way it secures is not by having your belt run through the clip by merely sliding it over your belt. This is ok for people who tend not to be on the move. But as I drive a lot, as well as move/lift/climb over/crawl under many things, this clip comes off way to easily.Does not allow chargin of the phone while in its holster.

 review/summary: Agree with previous reviewer
 review/text: I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although, my problem with the holster is that I have it clipped to my belt but the holster sometimes comes off by itself and I blame this on the design. All you have to do to get the case off is turn it 90 degrees and pull up. I have a PDA case with a similar design but it requires you to push a lever to have the case come off and it has never accidentally come of because of that lever. I have had the Siemens case come off many times when I was sitting and yesterday it came off on the street when I was reaching for something. It's a good thing a good samaritan found my phone and contacted me or else I would be out a phone. This is a good case if you don't plan on keeping the case on your belt but if you do I would look for something else. I currently have a Krusell case on order to replace this one. After yesterday's incident I don't plan on using it anymore.

 review/summary: Replacement / Second Charger - Haven't Used Yet
 review/text: I purchased the Sony Ericsson Travel Charger as a second charger for my Pay-As-You-Go phone. I use it as a replacement for my main phone (with the help of Google Voice).I haven't had the need to use the charger yet, but the order and deliver process was a cinch. I'll certainly update this review if I experience in abnormalities!

review/summary: Pretty good
 review/text: This phone is very good for being a phone. But they should do better with their music and video Vcast. I know I could just bring a mp3 player around but it would be good to have everything all in one. I didn't want to have to pay like 1.99 for each song (off Vcast) so i bought the kit that was suppoesed to let it work. i have figured it out and I can get on songs now but it took me a couple of days to crack their code. Also another problem is that when i had my songs from cds on it and then dowloaded a vcast song... it froze my phone so that I had to turn it off take the chip out and clear all my songs off.So for being a phone it would be 5 stars but the media gets very tricky.

 review/summary: Technology At It's Best!
 review/text: I bought this to replace my one-year-old Samsung SCH-A670.Here are my opinions on some of the RAZR's features-VZ Navigator-Great for when you're driving and you're lost, and when you don't have a navigational system in your car, like I don't.V Cast-Great for when you want to watch short movies or full music videos while on the go and you don't have access to a computer. The only con is that it only gets covrage in certain areas.Speakerphone-You can't always have your wireless telephone up to your ear, and the speakerphone helps with that, a feature my SCH-A670 didn't have!Ultra-Sleek Design-Wanna have the latest? The RAZR has the thinnest design!Camera/Video RAZR-It has a 1-megapixel digital camera with a 4X digital optical zoom. It can capture flix (video), too! But, you can't send anybody flix who doesn't have flix compatibility.Color-The gray color is in style right now, and the RAZR has that color!Overall-Since I bought the RAZR a couple of months ago, it has made me happy, except the battery died on me 2 months after I got it. I've always heard the battery life was short, and now I agree!

 review/summary: Not perfect but...........
 review/text: .....for all you complaining about pictures and music and the like, did you forget that this thing is a cell phone? So it has a 1.3MP camera. So it can play ringtones. If you want to listen to music get an MP3 player. If you want to take pictures get a digital camera. All of the complaining I read has nothing to do with the primary purpose of the device. Even the complaints about coverage is related more to your local area, not the phone or Verizon network in general.I bought this phone and Verizon service because we live on the cusp of a rural area. I've had Sprint, Cingular, and a couple of other carriers, but haven't been able to use their phones in and around our home due to lack of network coverage in our area. I found a website called [...] and found that Verizon owns a tower less than a mile away. So we got Verizon and we get great reception in our house! And with unlimited nights and weekends, and free calls to other Verizon customers, we never have to worry about overages on our plan.So do your homework and you can be happy with Verizon or any other cell company.

 review/summary: buy only if you want it as a phone only
 review/text: I had bought this as I wanted a phone that could take pictures, and it was advertized as being able to play mp3s, optional additional memory chip, etc. Sure, it is a decent enough phone, and build quality appears to be good, and it sure looks cool...those are the good features. For mine, I had to buy the phone tools software seperately(found at Amazon marketplace for 1$), in order to upload/download from the phone, and it cannot connect to the phone via usb due to driver issues. I have d/l drivers from motorola site and pc will never connect or even charge reliably, and sure cannot sync my contact list with it, guess I will have to send an hour entering the numbers manually. I never had issues with my old Nokia 6015 with this. Not a pc newbie. It just appears to be a lot of trouble to even bother with it. I am not using Verizon, but a small regional company. It is just a cool looking telephone only for me, and has me wishing I had done my homework better before ordering. The place to put the memory chip is inside the phone beneath the battery...which is pretty much a pain, too. The USB transfer rate is HORRIBLE, so much so that using it for mp3 player podcasts is useless...would take almost s long to transfer the files to the phone as to listen to them.

 review/text: I used this piece for 5 months and now I DONT like it.. people just cannot hear me on the other end - the volume adjustments are a joke. The body is sleek and smooth. I dropped the phone once and the front screen has a big crack now.. The reception is not good. My husband has a sanyo phone and it works perfectly when my razor doesnt even catch the signal.. There is no ring+vibrate option, i miss that option.If you still want to buy it, buy a leather case and a blue tooth to compensate for the fragile body and bad volume and deal with the signal issues :)

 review/summary: Not a bad phone.
 review/text: I just got this phone and there are some things that I love about it as well as some annoyances.I Love the design of the Razr. It easily fits into the pockets of my jeans. I like walking aound and not having a huge lump on my thigh. The keypad takes a little getting used to at first. After I used the phone for a bit, it feels just as natural as using any other phone.I have heard alot of people saying that the signal on the phone is horrible. I have had no problems with any dropped calls or calls breaking in and out even though i get very poor signal where i generally use my phone.The camera is aweful. Not that most phone cameras are very good to begin with but this one just irritates me. You have to hold the phone totally still for about 5 seconds while it takes the pix.Also, if you use a wired headset, you cannot use it if you are charging the phone. it only has one input and the charger as well as anything else you're going to plug into the phone go in there.All in all, i like it. I would reccomend this phone.

 review/text: I started my Verizon account with 4 razors. All had the same problems and none were recalled. You can count on the front screen glass breaking. The our phones were not durable and all have been replaced. BAD PHONE CHOICE. I always liked Motorola until now. I will never buy a Motorola product again. AND... Verizon was no help. After a month the phone broke and I had to file an insurance claim because it was not honored by warranty because they use the date of your first phone. Buyers Beware. Ask lots of questions.

review/summary: Limited Bluetooth, Verizon Car Charge stinks, Bad connector
 review/text: Some quick commentsFirst dont get the Verizon car charger. Mine had a tag on the cord which indicated that it must be disconnected after the phone is charged. Maybe to prevent battery overcharging? Useless for me on long trips! Verizon charger was over $30.00. At Staples a Motorola charge which can be left connected was less than $16.00.I use a Palm Pilot alot and can dial via Bluetooth phone numbers on other cell phones. This does not work on V3m. Also simple sending of contact information did not work. A quick look for software to connect V3m to Outlook or the Palm for daily schedules resulted in nothing. To connect the V3m to PC via USB appears to require a $30.00 package from Verizon.The V3m does NOT have a standard wired hands free connector on the phone. I did get a "converter" which I have not tested but even if it does the phone does not support both the charger and wired hands free at the same time. The converter may only be for headphones but even if it works with headphones it another thing to carry around or lose.Voice dialing does work great and speaker phone is good.

 review/text: I bought this phone with a one-year plan. I had an existing month-to-month plan with Verizon. Amazon assured me that although I would get a new phone number with the new phone, a simple call to Verizon would get my existing cell phone number switched to the new phone.WRONG. Verizon told me that they could never do that. So essentially Amazon customer service screwed me over. I will never trust them again.You might get by this problem by switching to a prepaid plan.

 review/summary: Just cool looking phone. That is left after re-branding.
 review/text: If you need just cool looking phone this is the item you're looking for.Cons:- There is a limit of 15 secods to capture video, why?- You cannot take any music you like and set it as a ringtone- Synchronize your pictures and videos is blocked (you can get them by sending via email for 25 cents per picture).- Verizon sell the phone w/o the software. But if you buy one it won't work. Don't waste your money.- Programming keypad (the only down arrow key can be reprogrammed)- For almost everything (ringtones, apps, etc.) you have to pay. If you're a parent think about it !!!- Useless card slot for micro SD card because you cannot transfer any files from your computer without taking it out from your phone- You cannot synchronize just any file for backup purposes from your computer- Anything else you're trying beyond "cool looking phone"Also it is good to mention some ludicrous features such as:- Vcast, tried for 1 month for curiosity. Number of channels is extremely limited and you have to have a very good reception (i.e. you cannot watch it in your car most of the time)- Get it now, what you can get from there?- Chaperone, tried for 2 weeks. Requires "special" Shrek-shaped chaperone-only phone for you kid with 4 buttons and a lot of airtime.Mediocre features (2 items)- VZ navigator with GPS (you will pay 2.99 per 24 hours)- You can make it work to synchronize music from your PC with some extra efforts (some info you can find here - [...]Pros (only 1 item):- cool looking phone and it is Motorola qualityPlease note, that nothing wrong with the phone itself. Just all useful features are blocked, and what is left augmented with something you not gonna use or pay for.

 review/text: This is my 2nd phone and although it is a nice phone it is limited by just how much you are willing to spend on monthly access fees and service charges.I refuse to pay for these bells and whistles, personally, so as it is this phone is dependable and sleek and gets pretty decent reception.One thing I have been able to do to get around some of the fees requiring downloading of ringtones is to create my own. You can use the voice recorder feature to record anything you want and then apply that recorded file as a ring tone. So I just put the recorder up to a stereo speaker (from a decent distance, actually) and sample whatever i want to use. I have even recorded my own farts and used them as a ring tone. Fun for the whole family! Just be sure to change it if you are on a date. Still fun though.Overall, it's nice to have a cool phone, but it's not much good unless you are willing to pay for it. In this case I am not, but maybe some of you out there are.

review/text: The RAZR V3m is the best phone out there. I've had a RAZR V3c, a KRZR, and a LG VX86000. The RAZR V3m was the best out of the 3. The 8600 is to fragile, the V3c was alright, the KRZR was slow. The RAZR V3m is a fantastic phone for anybody. You can drop it numerous times and don't have to worry aobut returning it because its durable. It also has great features such as VCAST, a fantstic camera, and a fantastic music palyer. The only con I can think of is the fact that the Verizon interface is ugly and takes away many features. So, if you want a phone that you can depend on for a long time, get the RAZR V3m.

 review/text: Simple put, The Razr is one of worst & best phones I've ever purchased. I purchased one for me and one for my wife. For a point of reference, my first phone was a Motorola Analog Startac in 1995.I'll lay out the good and bad, and let you decide for yourself.GoodVoice recognition - works very well.Layout and size - Button layout is good and size if great.Screen - Good size and resolutionCamera - Works well if you can get past the Verizon bs to get the pictures off the camera.Audio Quality - Good and good reception.BadSlow - OMG! This phone is so slow. Agonizing slow. Hit menu and wait 3 to 4 seconds for it to come up. Yeah that's right, 4 seconds, I just timed it.Battery - If you plan on talking on this phone, then you need to charge every night. If you talk during the day, charge it when your not on it.Ring - No ring and vib. Only ring or vib.This phone has a lot going for it, but the speed of the menu functions makes all the bells and whistles a distraction.

 review/summary: Good phone but short battery life and Verizon REALLY lock it down
 review/text: I have owned this phone for nearly a year now, and so thought it appropriate to write a review.Here are the good points:- This is a very slim phone. No more bulges in my pocket!- The build quality is great and it feels very solid and unlikely to break easily.- The dark gray color is very sleak and it has a nice metallic un-plasticy feel to it.- It has a impressive list of features - Bluetooth, Java games, a camera with quality higher than the standard VGA etc. to name a few.- It uses a standard mini-USB cable to charge which means that buying charger and/or data transfer cables is easy.Here are the bad points:- Very limited battery life. Usually I got somewhere in between 2 and 3 days (and I don't talk a lot!). I ended up buying a replacement battery from a 3rd party with a higher capacity. Now I get 5-6 days which is more reasonable.- A very annoying low battery warning. When this phone is anywhere near running out of battery it beeps loudly or vibrates for a long time (depending on the settings). It is not possible to turn this off, unless you silence the ring. In my opinion this makes it unusable when it is low on battery, and I always turn it off at that point. Why can't there be an option to change the low battery warning ring style independently of the regular ring, or even to turn it off altogether?- Verizon have changed the user interface to fit in with their brand. Menus have been rearranged and renamed. For example, if you want to download new wallpaper you have to go to the "GET IT NOW" menu and select "Get PIX & FLIX". Also, from reading reports elsewhere on the web I've heard that the user interface is not as usable than Motorola's default. Also I've heard that the default interface does not suffer from the slight delay that this has when navigating around the options screens.- Verizon have REALLY locked this phone down. You can't transfer data to or from this phone directly. For example, if you want to transfer a photo to your PC you can't use Bluetooth or a cable. The only way to do it is to E-mail it, and therefore pay Verizon. The same thing applies to wallpapers, ringtones and games. If you want them, you'll have to use Verizon's premium service, and pay them for it. Also, you can't manage the contacts using PC software because again Verizon have locked it down. This is VERY annoying. I believe that Verizon is the ONLY provider that does this to the this phone. Give us a break, Verizon, and let us decide how to use our phones!Overall this is a great phone with some relatively minor niggles. I have been pleased with it and it has been one of my better phones.

 review/summary: Nice to look at but don't try to call anyone.
 review/text: Had this phone (the new gray model from Verizon) for 10 days before taking it back. I loved the slim and stylish looks (a woman can actually wear it without bulk under a shirt, various toys (might someday use bluetooth, VCast etc but not right now) but the sound quality isn't that great. I noticed some fading in and out while listening to callers. This phone also dropped calls even in ordinary places like outside, and in a building with lots of windows. I only took 1 picture of my cat with the camera is fine. After about 10 days I noticed that the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than 2 days even though the specs say it is much longer. I charged it last night and after only 8 hours on and 1 phone call it is already telling me that it has a low battery. Then when I open up the cover of the phone to dial a number I started having to press the numbers several times before it decided to register that I am pressing the keys. This just started happening today and that was the final straw in deciding to return it. Other things you should know is to activate vibrate only you have to press 2 keys and go through a menu series to get it to be vibrate only. This should be a one key event. Also when the speaker for the voice activated dialing comes on you must press the speaker to hear her say "please say a command" otherwise it is so low you probably won't be able to hear it. Also when you are dialing a number it is hard to do without looking at the keypad. The keypad numbers are not raised enough to allow this and it is very easy to press the wrong number or in my case, think you pressed 10 keys when only to find out I only did 9. One more thing that drives me crazy, is that it is always dirty and shows smudges very easily plus even after only 10 days, there is already dust under the screen. It doesn't clean up easy I am taking it back and having them reactivate my old LG phone. For the price of this phone you can do better. Looks spiffy but that's about it.

 review/summary: If I could give it a ZERO, I would!!
 review/text: This is the worst phone I have ever owned...and I've had many. Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets TERRIBLE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures. Not worth it though! Think twice before buying this phone!

 review/summary: just got two
 review/text: I just got two of these gems and it is without question the best quality and featured phone I have used yet. No idea what the other users battery issues were I just played music, used VZ mapping and spoke on the phone for the past 2 hours and I have plenty of juice left... must have been a bad battery, both of mine last several days on standby and every bit as energy effecient as my Samsung 530 (without camera, music player, mapping, EVDO, etc...) I put 512meg MicroSD cards in mine and have loaded lots of my favorite music on them, the speakerphone in this is awesome as well. I just added the Motorola Bluetooth headset (820) and it was a snap to set up. Over all I could not be more happy with my purchase.I sync my contacts and my calendar with Outlook just fine using PhoneTools 4 and MediaPlayer 10 rips and formats all my MP3s perfectly for music so I really dont need much else.

 review/summary: All fluff, no substance.
 review/text: Admittedly, I don't use a tenth of the bells and whistles that this phone is supposed to have, I just want a phone. In that category, the Razor V3M falls horribly short.When the battery life in my LG4600 crept down to about half what it once was, I finally had an excuse to get a better looking, and hopefully better performing phone. The sales lady convinced me that the Razor was the best out there, so that's what I got. I was horrified to find that the brand new Razor battery lasted less than the half-strength LG that I had just gotten rid of!!!Pro's:1) It's a great looking phone. Of course, now EVERYONE has one in some form or another, so even that's not much of a pro now.2) Great big display! Very nice.Con's:1) MUCH worse reception than most phones I've had, just about everywhere I go.2) The battery life.3) Tinny-sounding speaker.4) Unlike just about every phone out there, you have to take it out of the plastic belt-clippy thing to open it for use, or charge it.5) Not loud enough. I sometimes have to put it on 'speaker phone', just to hear what's being said.6) Terribly user-unfriendly and counter-intuitive navigation menu. (8 selections to just initiate a text message?!? PLEASE!) In fairness, that may just be Verizon, not the V3M.7) Impossible to tuck between your shoulder and ear. In fact, even when holding, you have to 'fold' the phone a little bit to get it close enough to both your mouth and ear. Not the least bit ergonomic.8) WIMPY vibrate, even with full battery charge.

 review/summary: Hacks
 review/text: First off I did not buy this product at [...]I bought it from the [...]. I think this phone is a really, really nice verison of the razr, being that I've had 2 other razrs (v3 and v3i). This one feels a lot more sturdy in your hand, and it doesnt feel cheap as the v3 did, while maintaining its sleek, slim look, unlike the v3x which is a lot thicker. Furthermore, the camera on this razr is far superior to the previous versions, excluding the v3x(2 megapixels). It has a 1.3 megapixel camera, but I don't really use it for the camera, its only good for those surprise moments :P. Also I've noticed that the audio quality is a lot better than the other razrs, the songs/ringtones sound a lot more crisp and rich. Also the phonebook feature is fixed, I used to hate to have to wait like 30 seconds just to get to what contact I wanted (v3), Also new to this razr, is the voice command system, you can instantly look up numbers via voice command. You can also check battery levels, and signal strength. And the pause between letters in a text message is reduced, so no more waiting 2 seconds to type "no" :). Battery life is very much improved from the other razr models probably because this is a CDMA phone instead of the normal GSM razrs. A con however is the fact that if it gets scratched you will be able to easily tell it did, but I believe they offer this phone in silver if this is an issue. If you want to get really fancy you could get a custom case designed and handmade for your phone at vajacases.com.IF YOU BOUGHT THE VERIZON MUSIC ESSENTIALS KIT, OR THE VERIZON MOBILE OFFICE KIT, THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS POINTLESS FOR YOU TO READ. For the rest of us who don't see giving Verizon more money on top of the phone price and service charge, read on.As for the hacking part as one person said previously, you can use bitpim to hack this phone. If you want to put music onto it without wasting more money on that Verizon software that allows you to do so, simply find p2k phone manager, MAKE SURE IT IS THE VERSION THAT WORKS WITH CDMA PHONES OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK. There are some tutorials that I found useful to help you through this, and when you're done hacking and stuff, you can have a lot of bonus features that Verizon disabled, such as music/ringtone transfer with MPT(Motorola Mobile Phone Tools), wireless bluetooth transfer, disabling the ringtones that come with it, changing the outer LCD screen. If you choose to do any of these, it will void your warranty, it is not illegal however. If mobile phone tools doesn't detect this phone, you may have the same problem I did, I was running an older version of the software. Also to enable music and ringtone transfer you have to use seem edits, which can be done with p2k phone manager. See, Verizon disabled the feature by making MPT think that the phone was a v3m when in fact the software has the device drivers listed as v3mm, also if those steps dont work after reading some tutorials, you may want to select v3c as your phone model. Another thing, the cable that comes with it that you're supposed to plug you headphones into, is FOR SMALL HEADPHONES, meaning its a 2.5mm jack instead of a 3.5, so YOU NEED SPECIAL HEADPHONES TO USE THAT FEATURE. But me being me, found a way around this. I used a knife to pry off the top part with the M logo on it and got to the insides. theres a circuit board and some wires connected to the jack. I used another phone jack from one of my broken CD players I had lying around. They're exactly the same connections and size (the smaller jack and the bigger one) so I put the bigger one on top of the smaller jack and soldered it to the bottom part, if you know what you're doing this shouldn't take more than half an hour. After I was finished I used an xacto blade to carefully cut the shape of the new phone jack out(because with two of them the cover wouldn't fit, and I wanted the bigger and the smaller jack). Then I had to also cut around the little part that holds the smaller hole at the bottom as to make it fit. After this was done I used some electrical tape(mostly because I wanted the adapter to stay black not gray with duck tape) and proceeded to wrap around it. Hopefully if you want to save like 50 bucks from buying the Verizon software you will try this, but then you need to buy the memory card and that will set you back like the same price haha, but you'll have like 512 mb instead of the 128 mb that comes in the Verizon package. Best of luck to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to read this.I hope this information has helped you, and if it did I would appreciate you rating this as helpful.

 review/summary: Verizon makes it impossible to access some photos taken with this camera
 review/text: Pictures taken with this phone can be useless if you use Verizon Wireless. As other reviews point out, Verizon requires you to use its photo download service - you can't transfer files using Bluetooth or USB. That's annoying, but it's just the tip of the iceberg - Verizon has actually made it IMPOSSIBLE to get some of your pictures off the camera. That's because the phone takes pictures, apparently even using the default settings, that sometimes exceed the file size limit imposed by Verizon. For example, I have pictures -- including pictures of a graduation where I had forgotten my "real" camera -- that Verizon tells me can't be printed, can't be uploaded to the web, and can't be sent to anyone else. They are locked in my phone because Verizon has disabled file transfer software to prevent customers from, for example, buying ring tones from someone other than Verizon. So, to lock in ring tone sales, Verizon has locked my pictures in my phone. Compounding the problem, Verizon hasn't told its customer service personnel, or its technical support staff, who seem to be under instructions to blame Motorola. I wasted hours talking to Verizon people -- both in person at their repair office, and at their customer service line -- before finding out the truth on-line and getting someone at Verizon who admitted what's really going on. This would be a good phone, but Verizon has ruined it. If you want to use this phone as a camera, make sure you have a wireless provider that will let you access the photos you take.

If you choose to do business with verizon get everything in writing and keep good records because they lie and cant find records until you find them and suddenly they magically appear in their records.

 review/summary: BIG disappointment from Verizon
review/text: Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else. I succumbed to the hype of the Razr, but was burned. If it weren't for Verizon, the phone would be fine.

 review/summary: hack it!
 review/text: Okay, there are a lot of annoying things about this phone, but the good thing is that if you are computer savvy you can easily hack it. Google hack razr v3m and you will see many good guides. For instance, i learned how to replace the mp3 that plays the ANNOYING power up/down verizon jingle with a BLANK MP3. That means, no interruptions when shutting of my phone (saves a lot of embarrasing moments at lectures or meetings). Also, DONT PAY TO DOWNLOAD RINGTONES. The simplist thing to do is replace an existing one you hate with one you want. Same is to be said for downloading music. Why pay twice to listen to music?! If you have a few hours you can figure out how to hack it.ps. do love the thin design. would have given it a 5 star but the phone does take a lot of time to hack and fix all the verizon junk.

 review/summary: A nice little phone but Verizon limits it
 review/text: Let me first by saying I didn't know that I wouldn't be able to download songs to my phone or transfer the files from computer to device and device to computer. I bought both the Motorola phone tools, data cable and phone only to find out that I could not do it. I also bought both my husband and I's phone's with a mini sd card to expand the memory so that we could use it as an mp3 player as they were originally portrayed on tv commercials.I switched to Verizon because a friend of mine said they had great signal and phones. Phones yes, signal, it's so so. I do love the phone though, it's slim (fits in my pocket), has a camera, plays songs and I like the features. I also was upset that Verizon blocks you from being able to transfer your own files, so I finally seem edited (which is hacked) the phone. It's actually pretty easy, and now we are able to transfer files between phone and pc, and we can see the main screen from the outside of the lcd.The speakerphone is a little low if you ask me, I wish it were louder and the menu's on the phone are a little different then most. I wish these were easier to use and you were able to edit more of the phone. Motorola made a great phone, but Verizon kind of ruined it.The camera takes okay pictures, but they seem kind of blued as there isn't a flash if it's in low light. Good if it's outside, but not bad for a 1.3 megapixal. The camera is neat I think because I can take a few movies of the girls (I have two kids) and then transfer them to my computer for safe keeping. If you have the minisd card it's 5 minutes for a video...if not it's only 15 seconds (which is REALLY low).We also purchased the stereo headset where you can listen to music and answer the phone while doing it, it's something I recommend if you want to listen to music on your phone. It's not a bad player, but you can't do MP3's with verizon, they need to be converted to WMA files first and then transferred to be able to play them on the phone, which they are much bigger then MP3's.Overall, for the phone I give it five stars, but because it's with Verizon I only give it four.

 review/summary: Best cell phone I ever owned!
 review/text: I've had this phone for just over a year now, and it's been great! I'm waiting for UPS to deliver my next phone, RIZR Z3...RAZR v3m has served me well, and has even proven to be fairly sturdy even after a couple of drops in a parking lot, which I thought for sure was going to kill the phone after hearing about how fragile it is. Good thing I had insurance, but I haven't needed it. It has kept me from having to call Verizon support, which I was doing fairly regularly with my old phone Moto E815. I give RAZR v3m big kudos for that!As a phone, it's been superb! Good to decent coverage, good sound, no drops, no resets, etc. Best cell phone I ever had!Text messaging is as good as it can get with cell phone number pads. I also own an iPAQ, even had one with a tiny keyboard, and they are not any better so I chuckle all these cell phones with tiny little keyboards. Pair a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPAQ, now you're talkin!As an mp3 player, it will work in a pinch. All you iPod/iPhone nozis (replace o with an a, you know who you are!), please stick to your apple products and just leave the rest of us alone. I've own an iPod just long enough to know how much I hate iTunes, and now I own a Creative Zen which I like a lot, and no, RAZR v3m isn't as good as the Zen as an MP3 player, but so what? If I'm expecting to listen to music for a while, I grab my Zen and use my RAZR as a backup.As a camera, again, it will work in a pinch.I don't browse the web with this phone. I'm waiting for that day when someone comes out with a usable/affordable PocketPC based tablet ala Star Trek. Don't even talk to me about UMPC's yet... We'll see how well my iPAQ does with RIZR as Bluetooth modem.My rating is 4 only due to1) copying files to and from the the MicroSD is cumbersome2) Motorola Phone Tools3) RAZR uses some proprietary mini usb voltage so I can't charge the phone using one my many other mini usb chargers4) Verizon crippled some of the Bluetooth feature of this phone - Not the RAZR's fault.But if these don't bother you, then consider this as a 5 rating.

 review/summary: Verison kills the razr. Alltel makes it easy.
 review/text: I bought the $15.00 1GB microSD card and installed it the first day.Plugged the USB I had for my camera into the phone after formatting the card and downloaded a bunch of songs onto the micro by just drag and drop with windows. Dropped them into the Motorola/shared/audio folder.The phone recognized them right away. I moved some to the phone after it was unplugged and then realized the entire song could be used as ring tones. So I deleted the ones on my phone downloaded MP3 converter and cut into my favorite 20 songs (being careful not to overwrite any.) I saved them into the same folder on the phone with RT in front and moved them from the card to the phone after it was unplugged from the computer. That worked great for ringtones.When I want to download a picture from the phone I just make a copy from the phone to the card then plug the phone into the computer to take it out of the motorola/shared/pictures folder.No need for phone tools...

 review/text: I've had the razr about 2 months now and I like the phone and the sleekness but I'm actually in search of a new phone because the battery life on this phone is terrible. I don't have full conversations on this phone but do use the texting feature often and this phone almost doesn't make a full day with me. I almost have to charge it every single night. So for someone who actually does talk on the phone alot, I would NOT suggest this phone at all. I refuse to buy a new battery because like I said, I've only had the phone about 2 months. The features of the phone are nice and plentiful, takes really good pictures. But battery life is awful and also the phone kind of pauses when you press a button, sometimes it takes a few seconds to actually get your contacts up or view your messages after you've pressed a button.

 review/summary: Verizon does cripple OBEX but otherwise a nice phone
 review/text: While it's true that Verizon cripples the Bluetooth functionality in this phone (in fact they do this in several phones) you can work around this pretty easily by using a robust phone mngmt. package like BitPim (bitpim.org) and transferring files via the USB port. I've had excellent battery life with my Verizon RAZR, unlike other reviewers of this phone.Verizon's crippling of the Bluetooth interface is maddening, as is the fact that the Motorola Phone Tools software won't allow image/sound file transfer via the USB port. Again, the solution is use BitPim. Obviously Verizon is trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of their subscribers by forcing them to pay for everything they can, but if you work around that, Verizon does have an excellent network - my call quality is very very good.

 review/summary: Verizon V3m cellphone
review/text: I bought this phone in Aug 04 and have generally been very happy with it.The battery life is not as long as my wife's phone, but I have talked up to 4 hours in a day without any problem. I generally recharge it after 2-3 days and average about an hour of talk time each day. Even down at one bar, it works fine.The size is great! I really wanted a phone that I could drop into my pocket and not need a bulky case in order to protect it. The V3m fills the bill perfectly. I also really enjoy that there is no external antennae. The mp3 player works fairly well, but it does not have all the features of a dedicated MP3. It will let you put together playlists and play songs, which is enough for me.The most important thing with a cell phone (to me) is call quality. This is where I have been the happiest. I have used it in the St Louis area, small town SW Oklahoma, Fort Worth, along I-40 to California, and now live about halfway between San Francisco and Sacremento. Call quality is crystal clear with no static!Overall I am very happy with the phone.

 review/text: ok...so many people have complained about the verizon ui..yes..it sucks..however its there and if this really bothers you that much to deal with it then go elsewhere..and for those who arent going to buy this phone because of it...then dont get this phone...i will agree that i hate the ui..however i can live with it...now for everyone else I shall list the pros and cons of this phone as ive seen it so far....Pros:1. Reception and call quality-by far and away better then my previous phone which was the samsung a950...i live in an area with bouncing reception...usually ill get anywhere from 1-3 bars and its constantly going back and forth between them..usually at even 0...especially in my room..no diffrence in call quality....very good reception...voice quality and sound even at 0 bars...i feel like im talking on my normal home phone and not a cell2. Size-a huge reason why i got this phone...seriously i can sometimes not tell my phones in my pocket and have to reach for it to make sure its there...which probably leads to some odd looks from others..lol3.expandable memory up to a gig-ive got over 13 albums of songs on here not to mention tons of pics and videos...id recommend picking up this card because youll fill up this phones internal memory fast...ive heard rumors about a 2 gig micro sd card working...nothings confirmed yet..motorola and verizon typically say up to a gig of space...4.vcast music- this is part of the cons to...however the vcast music player is exceptional on here...it gives you so many options as to how you want your music organized..very handy :)5.battery-can last a suprising amount of time despite is tiny battery size..expect to charge it daily though...gets good use overall :).Cons.1.Lack of Customization-It has the standard Verizon UI as mentioned above...also only one key on the phone is customizable...the down arrow...frustrating that you cant...i dont know...set them all to what you want them to do. Also outside lcd not changeable from ugly orange. that is unless your tech savvy and know about seem edits...but this requires hacking...hacking to change the outer display!2.no mp3 playback-yes...and there appears to be no fix for that in the near future...it basically requires you to spend another 30 bucks on the music essentials kit from verizon to convert all your songs to wma files....which isnt bad...however its a slight diffrence in sound quality..not to mention an annoying slight glitch youll hear in every song no matter what. Verizons rectified this problem with other past phones released with this conversion needed and has readded mp3 playback in recent releases...the v3m will most likely never see that fix...Sidenote:appearently this is a razr thing...not sure about the lg's or samsungs..but appearently verizon didnt totally erase evidence of the motorola ui on here as its more of a hybrid of the motorola ui overwritten by verizon...a nice touch really :).So theres my review of the razr v3m for verizon. I place call quality, reception and the size of this phone over customization and other complaints I have about this and well all verizon phones now. The tf slot and vcast music capability have really come in handy for me and its a highly used part of my phone. Don't let the cons get you down...you get used to it and I can only hope that verizons network coverage and quality make you as impressed as it has me :). This phone is definitly recommended for your purchase!Also of note I own the gunmetal grey v3m initially sold by verizon and not silver but theres no diffrenct between the two really :).

 review/summary: Love the phone, but disappointed w/battery life.
 review/text: I really enjoy my new phone, switching cell # from Cingular to Verizon was simple, and the voice activation is a great feature. My main disappointment is the lack of battery life it has...3 hours is not a long time. My old Cingular phone allowed days of talk time before having to recharge. What good is a phone and plan if you can't use it longer than 3hrs of talk time and always worried you are going to lose connection. Other than that, the phone and features are great.

 review/summary: The RAZR is the deal!
 review/text: Well... I'm not one of those "high tech" guys that needs all the mp3 functions and/or the ability to upload music/picures to my phone. I love a phone that looks cool, has good sound, great basic features and the large screen doesn't hurt either. This phone has it all and I'm really happy with it.I just changed services from Sprint to Verizon and I couldn't be happier. The service I get when I am on the road is great. After a month and living in Houston, I haven't had any failures to connect or dropped calls. So far so good.The things I like about this phone...Regardless of what some have said about the "lack" of ringers included, I actually really like the few this has. There are some good fun ones and a couple generic (annoying) rings.This phone has an "alarm" setting, which my old Sprint phone did not have. Most phones have alarm settings now a days, but my old phone wasn't one of them. I've only used it once and it worked well for me.I LOVE the design. I'm a big guy with big hands and I love the fact that it feels as light and thin as a credit card. It has been said to be too "wide" for some people, but for my big hands it fits perfectly. All my other phones always felt just a little too small... like I was barely holding it with my fingertips. When I was trying out phones in the Verizon store, this one just seemed to feel the most comfortable to me.I love the screen. The menus are simple and easy to navigate through.NO ANTENNA!!! finally! I never understood why they didn't get rid of them sooner. My older phones had extendable antennas and they never helped. In fact, some of the time it made it worse if I extended it. Maybe it's the technology, but I love the fact there isn't a huge "bump" sticking out of my phone now.I enjoy the fact that as I sit here writing this review, my phone is plugged into my computer and charging with the same cable that I use for my digital camera. That's quite convenient and I don't even have to find an extra outlet at home to plug it into.The "voice dialing" is amazing. You don't even have to record any voice stuff (like I have on other phones). You just open the phone and click the button on the right side of the flip top. just say "call joe blow" and it'll ask to confirm, say "yes" and it dials. Super easy!The speaker phone is great. Very loud and the mic pics up from a few feet away, easily. I was using it just this morning while I was typing an e-mail and talking to a freind with the phone sitting on my desk next to me. I kept asking "can you hear me" and they'd say, "yeah, loud and clear". That makes me happy.I like that I can adjust the volume to turn it to "silent" without flipping the lid open.Lastly, I know I already said this, but the phone just looks super slick and cool. I love how it just slips into my pockets and doesn't feel like I'm carrying a huge boulder around in my shorts. It's light and easy to stash away.If I had to list off everything I don't like about this phone, I would not succeed in making it very long. There really isn't anything about this phone that I can say is "bad". If I were to be really picky, I'd say that it's probably very fragile. I'm not "on the go" with it that often and I'm usually stationary and/or indoors when I talk on it. I would assume that if dropped it could be damaged failry easily. I thought of this when I was considering buying it, so that's why I pay the extra $5/mo for the full equip. protection insurance on this baby. Can't be too careful. :)Also, the transfer of pictures you take from the phone to your computer??? I don't think this can be done. Some people have made points about how you can't upload/download from phone to computer, or vice versa... have to sign up for V-cast. That's a bummer, but I blocked it anyway... I can't aford the extra $16, or whatever it is, per month for that service. It's not worth it for me, personally.Lastly, of the negative pickiness I have for this phone, I do wish I could get rid of that stupid "Verizon Wireless" message that shows on the outside LCD and put something of my own there. That's me being REALLY picky here, but I have always been able to personalize the outter LCD on the other phones that I owned that had that.I hope my review was helpful to some. All I can really say to sum it up is that this phone was the hottest thing out there a little while ago and it's STILL a hot item. I have seen more people getting this phone now that prices dropped to make room for the new Chocolate and SLVR phones. I really liked the SLVR and almost got it instead, but I preferred a flip-phone over the non-flip. It's just a personal preference.I'm kind of a "low maintinence" guy with a fairly high maintinence phone, and I couldn't be happier with the RAZR!

 review/summary: Nice phone, but designed to milk your wallet.
 review/text: Bad things about the phone:Since when have you heard of a phone that doesn't vibrate and ring at the same time? Only vibrates or rings? I switched to this handset from a Motorola V551 and that one had some better features than this supposed upgrade.You can't customize the buttons to do what you want. For example, if you press the down key, it always goes to bluetooth options. In my other phone I had customized it to go to my contacts, but this phone does not let you change anything besides the ring tone and the wallpaper.There is an ugly red verizon bar at the top and bottom of your screen that can't be removed. Red does not match everything guys! There are only 3 color schemes, too.Speaking of which, Verizon charges for everything. They have the download option disabled so even if you do use the camera to take pictures you HAVE to email them to yourself, there is no other way to get them off your phone.1. No vibrate and ring, just vibrate or ring2. Very little customization3. Verizon has disabled all the file transfers except for when paying for airtime. RIP OFF4. Ugly verizon modifications that can't be removed off the screen.5. Takes forever to boot up, each button press is a little slow.6. Can't take a hit. If you drop it, the battery will pop out EVERY TIME!7. Can only record 15 seconds of video. I'm not sure if the additional memory helps this.8. You can't see what time it is when you're on a call! I don't know about you, but my cell phone doubles as my watch.9. There is no help prompts if you don't know what a function does.10. Uses BREW not java, so you wont find all the same games you might be used to.Good Things about the phone:1. It's very nice looking.2. The camera is pretty good for a camera phone.3. There is plenty of memory for pictures and text messages.4. You can store multiple numbers under one name5. The voice recognition is very good and works very well with bluetooth.6. The text message interface is excellent, maybe a few too many button presses though.7. Love the USB connection.8. Unlike some other Motorola phones, shows missed, dialed and received calls not just dialed and received.I switched from Cingular to Verizon and there are a few things I dislike about their service, but can live with.1.They bill you in advance. Tha's kind of weird considering I haven't made the calls yet. Maybe it's just the first month?2. They charge for incoming text messages. If you use yahoo or aim, those messages count as text messages instead of data. That's a rip off. What if I never read the text messages, am I still charged for them? I haven't quite figured that out.3. The service is the most expensive of all carriers and yet they charge for EVERYTHING.4. Their big service that they go on and on about, the EV-DOS highspeed Vcast, is not available in my area. Mobile web works fine though. Wish I had known that before.5. Vcast is $15 a month just for ACCESS to the service, once you get on, most multimedia items outside of news and weather cost a minimum of $1.99 each. What a rip off.Good things about their service:1. Their bill is clear and concise2. Their customer service is excellent.3. Network is really good. I can get calls in areas I couldn't with Cingular and other networks.Overall I'm happy with the phone and the service, just wish I knew these things in advance of purchase.

 review/summary: Moto does not deserve a second look
 review/text: I am really mad! I was impressed with the looks of the phone and the Motorolla name; after all they invented the cell phone. But Moto is going the way of GM, to the brink of bankruptcy and they deserve to lose us - their customers. The phone quality is unusually bad. The worst thing is the very short battery life. You must have a charger in the car or anywhere you go. If you are in a place of no reception (inside a large building) the phone dies in 4-5 hours. If you have good reception, the phone would live for 1-1.5 days. But wait, that's not all. The camera is so bad it is useless. Fuzzy and dark. Besides, there is no way to download the pix anyway without letting Verizon rip you off. But wait, that's not all. The phone has music capability but you cannot use it because battery life is too short. Though anyway, no musing without paying Verison rip off money. But wait, that's not all. The software is so full of bugs it is simply unfinished. For example, if the alarm goes off and you are not there to stop, it will go until the phone dies. Normal phones stop after a minute. The calendar is also very "buggy" to use. Voice recognition is a also a waist of time.The one and only good thing is the GPS, but this is not specific to Motorolla and costs $10 per month.To summarize, avoid Motorolla and forget Verizon.

 review/summary: Verizon's User Interface Ruins This Phone!!!!
 review/text: Hi All,I first want to say I think the phone is a great phone, but I'm very unhappy with what Verizon has done to it. I assumed I would be getting another Motorola product with the same Motorola interface I've had for the last few years with my T720 and my V710. Unfortunately, Verizon has put their own user interface (VCAST) on all their phones in a blatant attempt to make the customer pay for pictures and tones. It really defeats the purpose of purchasing a Motorola product. If you think you are getting a Motorola phone with the traditional Motorola software you are sadly mistaken. At this point I'm so upset with Verizon that I plan to return the phone and switch to Cingular.

 review/summary: Tough to Hear
 review/text: My husband is on his third RAZR phone--the first one just stopped working after a while and the second died about a day after the warranty expired. The replacement was not free and required a contract extension. It's nice looking, small functions reasonably intuitively, and the bluetooth earpiece is nice, but it's a pretty fussy little thing. When I use it, I find I can't hear the caller it unless I have it positioned at just the right angle to my ear and I spend half the conversation looking for that sweet spot and asking people to repeat things. Also, some of the screen pixels seem to go sort of semi dead so that they look a bit greyed out at certain angles. For the price of this phone, I'm not very impressed.

 review/summary: Excellent hardware design - Terrible software programming
 review/text: Since I have to give this product some "stars" let me explain the reasoning for the three. I give 4 stars to Verizon's phone service (maybe not their customer service) since it consistently works better then other carriers in my neighborhood. I give 4 stars for the hardware design and the audio quality of the phone and 1 star for the software design. My previous phone was a Motorola V710 and it was a much easier phone to work with.After sound quality and reception quality (which this phone excels at) my next requirement is that the phone has a decent contact function and calendar function. Here the RAZR is a step back from previous generation phones. While I can successfully sync my contact list with my computer by Bluetooth or USB (which the V710 never could do properly), the RAZR no longer has a useful group function. I used to be able to group numbers into several categories and easily access them with the push of a button, not anymore. You can make contact groups but I can't find a way to access the groups. Every name is listed alphabetically by first name! That's not useful. The calendar is hidden down several menus. The V710 allowed you to change position of icons in each menu, not in the RAZR. The V710 also allowed you to scan different months easily. With the RAZR you have to repeatedly click thru the days to get to the next month. I also found out that the RAZR does not allow computers to sync to the calendar! Why not?One more complaint. If you are looking for a phone that first vibrates and then rings, skip this model. It's not programmed to do it!The camera is decent for a phone. I haven't tried the music player or the video playback and probably won't. The GPS is a nice function which will probably come in handy during my next car trip. The phone is a good size and fits in my hand well during phone calls. If the problems I have with the phone don't mean much to you then it's a good 4 stars.

 review/summary: A good phone, but bad media device
 review/text: I was hoping to use this as both a phone and as a MP3 player on my commute to and from work. While I like the design and functioning of the phone, I am very disappointed with it as a media device. I just destroyed a recently purchased 1gig Micro SD Card trying to remove it from the V3 slot. There is no way to get my music collection to and from my computer other than transfering this type card between my PC and the V3. The design and location of the Micro SD slot on the V3 is just awful. Any tool which can get a grip the card in the V3 to help remove it can also destroy the card.

 review/summary: How To Kill The Perfect Looking Product.....
review/text: After reading some of the reviews, I'm on day 10 of the 15 day trial period, after sending my excellent E815 in for repair. I needed a phone ASAP. I can assur eyou all this phone is going back!I've always liked the look and coolness of the Razr, and figured it wasn't much different then the E815.Boy was I wrong!This phone isn't even in the same class! The E815 blows it away. But thanks Verizon, what do you do with peobably the best Motorola cell phone to date? Why of course, we cancel it!Of all fo the negatives your hearing here on Amazon--more specifically about the phone itself, I completely concur. Battery lif eon the phone seems like you'll get four to five calls max and then it's ready for a charge. What's worse is that I can't charge it and have an ear piece in at the same time. I know, I know, some of you are going to scream, "Well why dont' you go out and get a Bluetooth?" Well after losing my 4th Bluetooth in under 8 months, I've decided that experiment is now over. These things are just too easy to lose if you don't have it on your ear 365/24/7.I for one have no need what-so-ever for V Cast, Verison's hideous music purchasing site, I want to be able to change my icons on the damn phone I just got done spending $300.00 because I'm only 9 months into my current plan. Verizon doest not allow this!So moral of the story is, while the phone is great looking, it's just really not all that good of a phone. It's nothing but trouble from every aspect.Good luck for those of you that do buy it!

review/summary: Pink Razor - Sleek, Efficient, BEST reception
 review/text: Purchased 2nd Razor and went to COMLINK in Burlington MA to get the NEW CLEAR CASE! Its a hard plastic and protects the metallic case very well. If you play games and have high use, you may want to use clear packing tape to protect the toggle keys. It is clear and doesn't show. The reception and bluetooth feature work well in the BMW and not having wires in the car is great! Speaker feature is fabulous, reception is GREAT, graphics and ring tones are easy to find. The VZ Navigator is amazing and the GPS phone feature is helpful. You can download movies, MP3's, its great! I have purchased, Samsung, LG, Motorola, to name a few and always find Motorola to be the best quality.My monthly plan is 1200 minutes a month and therefore the flip phone is the best way for my specific needs. I see the new Chocolate Phone and I know I would wear out the mechanism that slides back and forth.Fabulous deal now for $19.99 a month with a 2 year signing.

 review/summary: Never buy this phone, Never buy from Amazon
 review/text: Phone Experience:Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone, charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone. This is slow and very limited capabilities. Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience:At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular. Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are: Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee, so your first month with activation will cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. Next, they charged me $15 because I ported my old number, in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone, with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon, they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store, the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha, who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you. After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I shouldn't have bought it from here, if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents don't buy from here, its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term.

 review/summary: Customer service disaster
 review/text: DO NOT buy this phone unless you're willing to endure continuous calls from Verizon Wireless if you try to close your account.Last week, shortly after telling Verizon's sales person I was switching to T-Mobile because their Customer Service is a disaster, I began getting three to five calls each day that hang up as soon as I answer. Doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, Verizon Wireless' number. Calling a supervisor (Jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their Do Not Call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. He also said this is a "known problem with Verizon's auto-dialer" for which Verizon has no solution. It's only noon and so far today I've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with Verizon Wireless.I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

I have the color magenta and everyone keep saying it looks cool and it does. All the features for me are great even the speakerphone. I would recommend this phone because it save space in your purse and everything works well.

 review/summary: Motorola RAZR V3, the Movie Star.
 review/text: Motorola RAZR V3, is not only one of the most popular cellular phones in the united state, but it can be considered without hesitation to be also a well known T.V. and movie star.First, Motorola RAZR V3 has very beautiful slim shape like most movie stars. Second, it has many stunning colorful dresses like silver, blue, black, pink and maroon. Third, and for most, Motorola RAZR V3 has been seen in numerous movies, television and reality shows.On the television game show Cash Cab, RAZR V3 was used by the contestants who seek assistance by phone. In the adventure reality show "Treasure Hunters", the contestants were given RAZR V3s for communication with the host and each other.The RAZR was also used by Detective Danny Messer during Season 2 of CSI: NY.I expect to see the rising star, Motorola RAZR V3, in Entertainment Tonight, Larry King, and many other late night shows. Good Luck.

 review/summary: The E815 was a much better phone
 review/text: If my E815 didn't have the restart problem when sending text messages I would have kept it. I sent it back twice for replacments and all 3 phones had the proble. It is very common and part of the reason VZW dropped it.The V3m is ok, but would be much better without the stupid VZW interface. The red bars across the top and bottom are annoying and the menus are not as user friendly as the Moto UI on the E815. It's all in what you're used to I guess. Verizon layers their UI over the moto OS to keep users from making the seem edits to enable features they don't want you using, unlike the E815 which was very easy to fix.I will live with it until my contract is up and go back to Cingular where they don't mess up a good thing. The V3i is a far superior phone.

 review/summary: So bad I had to change the phone
 review/text: I initially purchased this phone through Verizon: A brand new Razr. It looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. Every night I had to recharge the phone. Even when I did not use the phone all day, I still had to charge the phone at night. Same thing happened after exchanging the battery. I tried three different batteries, but same result. Maybe I had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. I simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. I would not get this phone if I were you. Hope this helped.

 review/summary: Motorola RAZR is a disappointment!
review/text: I wanted the Motorola RAZR for a while and I finally got one. Now, I just wish I had my old phone back. Here's why I don't like this phone:- buttons on the side are easy to accidentally push- the standard ringtones are terrible and you must pay for any new ones- the battery doesn't stay charged for more than a couple of days- frequently used functions are not very easily accessedOverall, I had high expectations for this phone. I thought I was getting this high tech, cool new device and it's not even as good as the simple three-year old phone I was using!

 review/text: Although this phone is nice and small I regret ever switching to it. Verizon puts the worst operating systems on their phones. I like to leave my phone on vibrate and keep it in my pocket. But this phone never stops vibrating. When a scroll down a menu, or when a miss a call or when the battery is low it just vibrates over and over. Its driving me mad!

I have a 2Gb MicroSD card with music on it, and it sounds wonderful.As for battery life, I got the extended battery, and I haven't had a chance to really keep track of battery life. But it's very good.

 review/summary: Wow, Finally a phone that lives up to the hype
 review/text: I have had this phone for a little over a year and have to say I think it's still the best phone currently offered by Verizon. It's rugged enough to deal with life's daily hazards and also light enough to carry in your pocket.The reception and voice clarity are second to none with voices coming in crystal clear just about everywhere. If you have the Razr with Verizon do what I did and go to the store to get it flashed to update it's UI. It operates much better with a better sounding music player and the whole phone operates much quicker. It also allows more customization like changing screen brightness and the wallpaper on the outside screen.I don't know what people are saying about poor battery life because I can get about three hours fifty minutes talk time on a single charge. With normal use I get about two to three days use before a recharge is needed.Sure, the Razr has been out for a while but it's still one of the best phones out there. I don't hesitate to recommend the Razr V3M and with the new update it makes the phone all that much better.

 review/summary: You'll be sorry if you buy this phone
 review/text: Unless you are a teenager with someone paying your bills, or looking to join a class-action lawsuit, this deal will be a nightmare. I bought 4 of these phones for family members and they are all going back.The RAZR is a crippled phone, now lacking key features that were built into it. Verizon claims it is BlueTooth capable, but that is misleading. It won't link to our computers. It was quite a frustration to discover that Verizon purposefully prevents that.Connecting it directly to a laptop, the USB cable is reduced to a battery charger. You are prohibited from transferring files either way. I take a lot of pictures. They recommended a 2GB storage card and installed it for me. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that it is impossible to transfer my image files to the computer by cable or BlueTooth. In order to get my images, I would have to pay Verizon 25 cents per image or $500 for a full card of images. No kidding.And if you want a non-idiotic ring tone, or anything else, you pay and pay and pay extra charges to Verizon. Go ahead and google "razr bluetooth" if you want to fully appreciate the horror Verizon has unleashed on its customers.Or save yourself the trouble and hair pullout, and find a better phone with a better company. The Verizon RAZR makes the iPhone look dirt cheap.

 review/summary: A nice sleek phone
 review/text: I recieved this phone for free with the $200 credit once I completed my 1st contract with Verizon. I really like this phone, its hard not too. I like the brushed aluminum look and its a very well designed phone. The keypad is extremely nice and is SUPERIOR to other phones I've owned when trying to dial in the dark. The screens are both nice and bright and very clear. I've never had any connection problems with this phone, and callers voices sound very clear. The speakerphone works very nicely....loud if I need it to be and clear. VCAST is nice for downloading music and ringtones and games. Some of the stuff is a little expensive, so I rarely use it. I really hate the fact that this phone from Verizon is altered by Verizon so that you cannot put your own ringtones, pics, etc on the phone...but that is not something I can blame on Motorola. The battery does not last as long as other phones I've owned in the past, but it does get me through the day. I can use the USB cord that came with my MP3 player to charge the phone from my MacBook Pro...I find that HIGHLY convenient. All in all I really like this phone. Its nice to carry, look at and hold. Its also easy to use, despite its futuristic design and new technology.

 review/summary: V3m is about as good a CDMA slim phone you can get.. for now.
 review/text: ---Pros and Cons:P: popular model, so accessories are plentifulC: popular model, so you're not uniqueP: VZ Navigator (VZN) for $10/mo is very useful... Voice navigation with street names being read aloud is nice.C: It uses minutes to re-calculate routes, so it's not unlimited usageP: VZN doesn't need the $15/mo VCastC: ..which is nice if you don't use VCast, but the point is that there's no way to get unlimited VZN use.P: Speakerphone is loudC: ..but not loud enough when drivingP: Voice prompt person/phone number lookup is greatC: ..but sometimes still requires pushing a button, making it not truly hands-freeP: mp3/mpeg4/jpg playback is neat; convert video to 3GP using a tool called "SUPER" - www.erightsoft.comC: controls are clunky, screen resolution small, no full-screen supportP: expandable memory for 1GB of mp3/mpeg4/jpgC: you need to remove the battery cover and battery to gain access to itP: lightweight, slim metal housingC: easily scratched; I bought a $25 skin at shildzone.comP: easily readable display, keysC: 176 x 220 resolution and 65k color depth is pretty lowP: Verizon interface is faster than the Moto interfaceC: verizon interface... yuck, yuck, yuckP: V3m supports BT Dial-Up-Networking (DUN) profile so you can use your phone as a high-speed modemC: While it does work, if you plan on doing more than just testing it out, the Terms of Service require you purchase a data plan for ~$50/mo. It's a shame they don't have flexible day/week plans for the occasional traveler.---Cons with hackable resolutions:C: Vibrate + Ring is disabledC: BT OBEX is disabledC: Motorola Phone Tools Multimedia button disabledC: self-imported mp3 ringtones are disabled= all have unofficial work-arounds; see mark.cdmaforums.com---Cons with no resolutions:C: BREW instead of Java - which means a very limited number of games and appsC: I have average-sized hands, and find the 4-way button and the middle button to be difficult to press.C: Signal at my house, in the middle of a metropolis, is 0-1 barsC: one day of standby + 5-6 calls + 15-minute VZN usage = 50% battery. Woah, go CDMA...C: the 1.3MPixel camera takes worse photos than my VGA camera from 1997 - I'm not kidding.C: the video camera is absolutely pointlessC: As much as I enjoy VZN, it loses signal once in while, which left me in some uncomfortable situations.C: With a subpar web browser and non-live TV clips, I found VCast to be absolutely pointless. Sprint's live TV feed definitely adds more value.C: CDMA, so this phone won't work overseas.---Conclusion:All in all, a decent phone that's great for someone looking for a slim CDMA phone with expandable memory, mp3/mpeg4 playback, and Navigation. As a previous GSM customer, the Verizon lockdown of the phone is just mind-boggling, but at least they can be disabled with some work. If I wasn't being forced to go Verizon, I'd still go GSM. Good luck!

 review/summary: The VZ Navigator Is Worth the Price
 review/text: I don't really care about the multimedia features--when I want music, I use my Ipod shuffle and when I want pictures, I use a digital camera--so I'll focus on the device as a phone rather than a music/video player or camera.Pros--The looks and size, of course. I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need. If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds. The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that. For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles. This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be "taught" and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone. You sometimes hear "the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless." That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option. The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring. I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail. As is, you have to open the Razr to check this. An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts ("Do you really want to delete this missed call?"). There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it. Like all phones, I'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking.--I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook. I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon (iDatebook) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one.--The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java. I particularly miss World Mate for international travel (especially the currency converter) and a shopping list application.--It's CMDA only so for for international travel, I've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all, though, the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I've owned over the years.

 review/summary: User experience affected too much by choice of service provider
review/text: I've been using this thing for about a week now, and it's a big upgrade from my near-giveaway Ericsson T316. I strongly recommend a case, since the housing of the current-generation Razr is plastic (earlier versions were encased in metal). Unfortunately, this increases the bulk of the device, when one of its draws is the slim design. I opted for the Verizon-branded Verizon leather dealie, which is custom-fitted for the phone. Unfortunately, the belt clip cannot be removed from the leather case, short of brute force.Also, the camera is nice, but Verizon has disabled the Razr's OBEX feature, which allows you to transfer things between your phone and a computer -- like photos, ringtones, wallpaper, et cetera. You have to pay an additional fee to email pictures to yourself or someone else, which is irritating. There are ways around this, but they void the warranty and may damage your phone's firmware, possibly rendering it unusable. In fact, even *entering* the phone's test mode will void your warranty. I find this a little condescending and authoritarian for something I bought and paid for.I have to say I'm tempted to try, though, since Verizon wants me to pay $2.99 USD per additional ringtone, which is honestly ridiculous. (There may be cheaper ringtones, but that was the price point I saw on all tones I found via their "Get It Now" service.)Since the phone is incredibly popular, you should have no trouble finding an online community for advice, some support, and helpful tips. And there are loads of accessories, including a wireless Bluetooth headset with voice command recognition. Unfortunately, Bluetooth isn't a very secure protocol. To their credit, Verizon mentions this fact in the manual.What I didn't notice in the manual was the fact that the phone is apparently disabled when in recharge mode. This morning I was almost late to work because the phone's alarm clock didn't go off. With the T316, I could plug it in at the end of the day, go to bed, and wake up with a fully charged phone blaring its alarm at me. The T316, like most phones, also does vibration and ringing simultaneously, while the V3M does not. This is a curious omission, especially at this price point, but it's not a deal-breaker, for me.Lastly, I had to dig through several pieces of documentation before I discovered that I had to call a special 3-digit number to actually activate my phone -- and this must be done every 30 days or so, a fact I *never* saw anywhere in their product descriptions. And the notifications on the phone's screen don't clearly indicate when activation has completed, at which point I can safely disconnect the call. I believe only Verizon requires you to literally phone home on a periodic basis.I would much prefer a notification prompt that a network or phone upgrade is available, rather than having to call Daddy VZ every few weeks to check in and let him know that Little Johnny Subscriber is alive and well. The way I see it, I pay them my monthly fee, and they let me do my thing. I'll call them if I need something. Otherwise, let's just be friends, okay?It's a nice-looking, widely supported device with solid sound quality, but Verizon's attitude towards the user experience is disappointing. OBEX is standard in the Razr phone -- don't break it and tell me I'm not allowed to fix it, and don't offer me (IMO) overpriced items and services to compensate. It's too bad that the user experience can be affected so much by who you use as a service provider.

 review/text: This phone is pretty good as a phone. The display, keys and software are all quite user friendly. I have found the sound quality and battery life to be quite good. I don't talk on the phone much so I can go five or six days without charging.My one phone-related complaint is that vibrate and ring is not supported. I have never seen a phone that makes you choose between vibration and an audio alert, but this one does.The camera is quite easy to use and takes respectable pictures for a phone. There is a camera shortcut on the keypad that takes you to the camera mode.My main problem with this phone is that Verizon have disabled bluetooth file transfer. This means you have to either remove the memory card, or pay to transfer music and pictures to and from your phone through Verizon services.

 review/summary: style over function
 review/text: People who haven't used this phone can't understand why I dislike it so much because it is supposed to be so "cool". I bought it because it was one of the only Verizon phones that seemed likely to work with my Macintosh and iSync to transfer contacts over Bluetooth. While I had mixed success in that regard there is lots of other things about this phone to not recommend it.As for the physical form; the screen is an absolute blank outdoors in any kind of sunlight, the speaker phone key on the side is easy to accidently activate and I was constantly broadcasting my calls to everybody until I learned to be more careful, the same thing with the voice menu key on the other side, and the center select button on the 4-way navigation key is very difficult to push for anybody with fingers larger than Barbie (I had some success using my fingernails until I trimmed them).The user interface is horrible and I wonder if anybody actually tests these things; it can play music and take pictures but still has only one lousy field for the contact name (forget about sorting by last name or trying to keep track of a contact by their company name), all contacts get assigned speed dials and they must be moved, not deleted (very tedious to organize and so I only did it for the first 10 or so speed dials), you don't know for sure what speed dial number you are calling until the call has been initiated (unlike my old phone that would display the contact before making the call; I know they are speed dials but I don't always remember which number I assigned), it takes several key presses to activate "vibrate only" (as opposed to one convenient key press on my old phone), get used to the "get it now menu" and the "mobile web" because most of the navigation keys manage to take you there (there is only one assignable navigation key press and it can't be "recent calls", something I used a lot on my old, uncool phone) , backing out of menus is inconsistent (sometimes it is a soft key, sometimes the clear key, sometimes the end key), assignments made for speed dial or custom ringtones don't always seem to stick (for instance, the speed dial number seems to work as assigned but the "contacts" listing shows a different speed dial), and the "iTap" predictive text entry mode is a joke (producing nothing but esperanto for my simple messages). That is enough for now but I could go on.I was able to transfer my contacts to the phone using iSync but I did not try anything with the calendar. Besides the name limitation mentioned above, only "mobile", "home" and "work" numbers are recognized (in addition to email and fax). A subsequent sync overwrote all my speed dial assignments. Given the difficulties with that feature (see above) I don't think I will do that again soon.The voice quality and reception are good but using this phone is frustrating.

 review/text: I got Razr for my wife, along with a LG VX8300 for myself. Must say Razr disappointed me. I think the audio quality is very poor, the opening and closing of the phone with one hand can sometimes become tricky with the constant fear of dropping it. Somehow gives u a feel of very flimsy and easily breakable phone. Verizon has disabled all the nice features, including the Bluetooth which has made transferring all the numbers a night mare. The LG vx8300 started communicating with my old Motorola v505 and I transferred all my numbers within 15 minutes without a hassle. The battery life also is also not that great.Overall, its stylish, cool...whatever, but it lacks the utility and sturdy feel to make it the phone of choice, well at least for me.

 review/summary: I Own This Phone - Wish I Hadn't
 review/text: I don't suggest buying this. I have a Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless) and I wish I hadn't gotten it.Verizon Wireless uses their proprietary software to lock away features that come standard in Motorola RAZRs.* So you can't get ringtones or music onto your phone unless you spend money through their proprietary V-Cast system. That's right, no copying from your PC to your phone.* You can't download pictures to your computer. They suggest e-mailing it to yourself.* You can't upload pictures to your phone unless you (yes, you guessed it) use their service.Lastly - and I've called and checked with their technician on this - there is NO WAY to copy all of your text messages from your phone to your PC. So if you've been texting up a storm and you want to save them, sorry.I've tried buying a USB plug that connects between my RAZR and my PC. I've even purchased two different brands of software at Fry's Electronics that's supposed to enable you to transfer stuff easily between phone and PC. Unfortunately, they won't work because my RAZR is from Verizon Wireless. In fact, there are discussions on Web bulletin boards on hacking into your Verizon phone in order to disable Verizon's software locks - just so you can get features that come standard on the Motorola RAZR.In the end, I feel suckered and duped by Verizon. I'd rather get a product that lets you do all of the above for free.

 review/summary: A wonderful, [crippled,] powerful, [useless,] cool little piece of [vandalized] gadgetry
 review/text: Motorola produced a great phone here. It's very thin, not even noticeable in my pants pocket until I reach in and "feel around" for it. The phone part works fine, it offers Bluetooth headset support, doesn't have an ugly antenna sticking out, has a speakerphone coming out the rear end that sorta works (nothing like the LG 4650), offers a color LCD on the front panel, has a built-in camera (that, unfortunately, looks awful), charges and connects to a PC via USB, and offers EDVO high-speed internet access for its built-in web browser.And then Motorola took the device and sold it to Verizon Wireless. Verizon then passed it to their profiteering executives and evaluated the feature set. "File transfer? Kill it! Forget about transferring memos and photos from the phone; make 'em pay messaging fees to e-mail that crap to their home computers. Nobody needs to transfer binary stuff unless they're going to save photos taken with the camera, in which case our e-mail system works FINE, screw USB and Bluetooth. As for bringing stuff up to the device, call it a music phone, build it around music, but make 'em pay. Yeah, paint the whole user interface blood-red and put 'V-Cast' graffiti all over it. Make 'em download songs for $2 per song. But don't let 'em actually use stereo Bluetooth heaphones for listening to music. No, make 'em use the speakerphone for the music. It's OUR phone, anyway, and we can dictate what our customers can and can't do all we want. Oh, and national access? Kill it! Broadband access? Hahaha!! Come to think of it, to top it all off, just let them burn in hell if they ever do anything USEFUL with the phone besides use it as a phone, take crappy pictures that can only be stored locally or be sent via e-mail, or download music off of V-Cast. All those other features... kill 'em, and void the warranty if the user even attempts to enable ANYTHING we disabled.""Good call, sir. Good money."Overall, I was completely stoked about this phone when I ordered it and was waiting for it to arrive. I got it free with the "new every 2" plan from Verizon Wireless, but have spent well over $100 to $150 on accessories including Bluetooth stereo headphones which the device DOESN'T SUPPORT for stereo music playback (everything goes through speakerphone). I have also pounded my head against the computer for days trying to get it to sync to the PC using the Sync Music feature, but every time I run Sync it reverts back from Portable Device to Modem even immediately after Windows Media Player recognizes it. Obviously a glitch in the V-Cast software, but who cares? Not Verizon!!I am going to consider putting this phone out on eBay and reverting to my old crappy LG phone.

 review/summary: Beyond Crummy
 review/text: This phone is a disaster. Please read this and rate well and keep it at the top so that others can be fairly warned before buying (or not, hopefully!)Barring the keypad defectiveness for which I've had NO END of hassle with amazon in trying to 1. get a replacement phone sent 2. get the rebates which are now expired due to the time it took to get the replacement and 3. hassle with VERIZON over the same things, here is my evaluation of this phone:I thought something was WRONG with this phone, the way it drains the battery. This is the most important flaw. I've never seen a phone that eats battery as this one does. (Amazon negative: When I called Amazon to return it, I tried to EXCHANGE it for a different one and THEY DON'T EXCHANGE CELL PHONES. Let everyone be aware and ware of this. NO CELL PHONE EXCHANGES. They will REPLACE a phone if it is defective, but no EXCHANGES! They don't say that when you purchase.) I am now buying an extended battery (AND a new door, you have to buy the door for the pink one separately because they don't sell it anywhere else than Motorola Website) for a total of about 65$ more.Secondly, both Razrs (the original and replacement) experience keypad freezing. The replacement only once, when typing a txt msg. The original would freeze continually, once it froze when the alarm clock was going off and I had to take the battery out for it to stop!Third: The sound. The volume when in a call is really bad. It is so very hard to hear on this phone, with the volume turned all the way up.Fourth: you can't CHARGE the phone and talk on a 2.5mm headset at the same time. This phone has ONE mini-USB port and comes with a wall-charger and an adapter for a 2.5mm headset. But if you have a 2.5mm headset because you don't like Bluetooth (because it's yet another gadget you can't hear very well on and can't remember to charge), no charging the phone while you talk!Fifth: the way Verizon ties up the ability to use this phone is SHOCKING. They seriously are vultures about it. They try to make you pay for everything they can, mobile office kits, ringtones, downloading photos to your phone or sending. It's 25 cents per picture message unless you have a picture message plan!! (DON'T BUY MOBILE OFFICE KIT (another 40$), instead buy a microSD card and reader and get the pictures and txt items from there).I hope that if you are thinking of 1. verizon or 2. motorola razr you will think again, because you are asking for hassle, stress, a phone that ALWAYS needs charging and makes you nervous to talk because it will drain the battery. Please get a better phone, a better service provider !!

 review/summary: -1 for the customer
 review/text: This is a good phone that was messed up by Verizon.You can't transfer your files from the phone to your computer. Verizon wants you to pay them for the privelage and use their network to transfer.If you were to ever call them and ask them about it they are GREAT at Passing the buck.Even though you may have bought the phone in a verizon store from verizon they say it is motorolla's fault that you can't transfer your pictures. Despite the fact that their version of the RAZR is the only version that is crippled in this way.Furthermore they have made it so that you can't change the red colors that permeate the interface. This is just adding insult to injury. If you want to add your own custom ringtones, there are two ways, the easiest of course is to pay verizon money to send it to your phone. Other ways are hacks that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Also you can't make the phone vibrate and ring at the same time. My ancient nokia, that I had in 2000 did this and so has every other phone I've owned since. I don't even understand why Verizon would disable this.There is one feature I'm am not totally happy with, that is not Verizons fault(as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised). The camera takes the crappy pictures you would expect from a phone. Unless your hands are shaky like mine. In that case it will take pictures even crappier than what you would expect from a phone.The phone itself is slick. It's thin, the ergonomics are better than any other. Verizons voice calling features are great. The fact that the address book interface is clunky doesn't matter one bit when you can just tell your phone who to call. You can whip it out and dial all with one hand. Then have it on the speaker phone while you are waiting for someone to pick up. As a phone it's hard to beat, but these days I think we are allowed to expect more.The saddest part is that it's my favorite phone from the company with the best network, you really can't win.

 review/summary: Very Dissastified
 review/text: I have had the V3m for about a year. Sorry I bought it from Verizon. Can't wait until my contract is up. Same complaint as other reviews - disabled multimedia features. In addition, I like to carry it in my pocket - without the case. That's why I bought a thin phone - no bulge in pocket. But when you take the phone out of your pocket, sometimes the protruding buttons on the side activate the speakerphone or change the answer mode. A real pain. The buttons should be recessed.

 review/summary: Not sure what the complaints are about
 review/text: I just upgraded to this Motorola Razr. Like most of you, when this came out I really, really wanted one, but they were just too pricey. Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy. I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The "flat" buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit. I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me. The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem. If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option. I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two. The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect? Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said: If you want a decent camera get a decent camera. If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA. If you want an iPod get an iPod. This is a very good phone with lots of extra features, but it's not perfect. Personally, I don't think the perfect phone exists -- yet.

 review/summary: Beware this phone --- the warranty is no good!
review/text: I ordered one of these phones in December '06; it was defective right out of the box. Returned it and got another, which worked fine for a month. Then the phone would not charge when plugged in. Instead it gave me an "Unauthorized Charger" message, even though I was using the factory charger. Verizon would not exchange it even though the phone is supposed to have a one-year warranty. Check online on cell-phone forums and you'll find this is a common problem with RAZRs.

review/summary: WARNING!! ZERO BATTERY!!!! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!
 review/text: Well...Two of the main differences between Verizon's Razrs, and the ones that come fromT-Mobile, and Cingular are as follows:difference #1:CDMA vs. GSMOnly the Verizon Razr runs on their CDMA network. The CDMA network sucks electricity out of the phone like a vampire!They say: "200 hours standby" vs "400 hours standby" on a GSM Razr.Your actual time may vary.My actual battery life was: 20 minutes of use within a 28 hour period of standing by, and the phone was beeping loudly that the battery was completely dead! And No, I did not listen to any music, or watch Vcast, or anything like that.difference #2:Bluetooth:Verizon shuts off the OBEX portion of the bluetooth that Motorola put into the phone when they built it.What that means is: You can not transfer anything to or from the handset via bluetooth. Take a picture, or video? Pay us to email it to yourself. Music? Your Own Ringtones? Buy those from us too.One note: I did not get mine from Amazon, I got it from Verizon directly.Verizon's customer service is also very lame. If they ever get my account straightened out, I AM GOING TO get my next phone from Amazon,and it will be from T-Mobile, or Cingular.

 review/summary: Useful cell phone
 review/text: I just upgraded from an older cell phone to this version.Motorola, I know, saw its market share diminish by not upgrading its phones. However, this particular model represents a major improvement for me.It takes a bit to get the functions straight (but, then, I'm a technophobe and not real techno-literate to begin with). However, I have been able to pick up the specifics and choose what options I wish (e.g., answering the phone by simply opening it). I was able to change ringer tones handily; it was easy to program voice mail; it was simple to access the web through the phone.I was even able to send my first text message (yes, I know, primitive).All in all, I'm pretty happy with this. I am well aware that there are much more powerful and fancier cell phones out there. But I prefer something simple and easy to use. And this fills my bill nicely.

 review/summary: If you want a quality phone, do not buy this one
 review/text: I have had this phone for a week and was about to take it back due to the bad sound quality when the glass window on the outside of it broke. True, I dropped it, but it's amazing that one drop could shatter the window. I looked up this phenomenom on the internet and have found several postings about how fragile the glass is. One person said that it cracked when they pulled it out of their pocket. I had my previous phone for 3 years (not a razr) and dropped it accidentally several times, it did not break once. This phone is not worth the hype. The sound quality is not great and it's much too fragile for real people.

 review/summary: Solid phone, pricey features
 review/text: The Motorazr V3m is a solid phone- making and recieving calls is easy and effective, the operating system is consistent, and it looks small and stylish on the outside. However, once you go beyond simple phone tasks, things get more complicated.First, the exterior: it is sleek and thin, and looks very good. One problem is that the outside tends to smudge, but this can be corrected by wiping the phone off. The keys are nice, which is amazing because they are so thin. The d-pad in the middle is a little hard to use, though- the phone could have used a little more space around it.As for basic features, almost everything is very accessible and intuitive (with the exception of the camera, which is hard to get to from the menus). The contacts software allows you to add multiple numbers for one entry at once, which is a bonus. Settings are easy to find and change. Messages are straight-foward, however, if you miss more than one message and then say "yes" at the screen that asks if you want to check them, you are taken to the newest message, which can be confusing if the earlier message is connected to it.Now, the extra features that Verizon advertises are the disappointing part. I know this is common for phones, but just remember that what is advertised does not come with the phone for free. You must pay pretty hefty fees for web browzing, Vcast (video service), downloading ringtones and using the navigation system. Even the games are only demos and can only be used once. I have tried the navigation software as well as the browser, and both are top-quality. It is up to you to decide whether you want to pay the fees ($10/mth and $6/mth respectively). Music is also difficult to transfer from your PC- I have had no success trying a USB cord I had at home, so you might need to spend another $20 to get the propritary cord. The bluetooth software with the phone does not support file transfer.Overall, a good phone for everyday needs, just make sure you know what you are getting into.

I use a holder -- it makes the phone a bit thicker, but I have known several people who have cracked the screen or loosened the connection between the two parts just by dropping it once.:)

 review/summary: Lots of Marketing Hype
 review/text: UPDATE AFTER USING OVER A MONTH: The phone is too large (it's flat, but over twice the size of my previous free LG phone), and gets in the way when sitting, and especially when driving with a seatbelt (was never a problem with 3 previous phones).ALL the belt-clip holsters for the phone are AWFUL. The phone has dropped out of the holster and onto concrete five times in the first month alone. What was Motorola thinking. I'll never but another phone without first making sure it has a suitable holster.Feature-wise, the camera is a novelty that I've used a handful of times the first week. I dont care about novelties or gimmicks, I care that the signal is clear, and the phone has worked well in that regard.I may ultimately deactivate thie phone and switch back to my old phone; we'll see if it survives a few more falls out of the holster onto concrete.---------Original Review:My "old" phone was smaller, this phone is huge. Yes it's flat, but it's almost three times the width.There are too many nonsensical features that do not aid or improve the act of making a phone call (video, camera, music, etc).One surprisingly nice feature is the voice recognition ("Call Joe Mobile") which works very well. Wouldn't have thought that would be a useful feature, but it works great. The main screen is very good, with plenty of resolution to handle long contact names, and the software displays pseudo scrollbars to indicate more content is offscreen (nice touch).The LCD on the outside is redundant, and removing that should help make the phone smaller (and cheaper).The "holster" does not come with the phone, and Verizon wanted twenty bucks. Several types are available online for 1/3 the price, but none of them (including the Verizon version) work as good as the free holster that came with my "old" phone.The battery only lasts 2 days (with 1-2 calls a day, and NO game playing or picture taking).While the phone is beautiful, and an engineering design masterpiece (looks sexy), it's too big, and was designed more to look at, than to be carried by a human. It's almost too large for a holster (hits your leg when sitting) and is awkward to hold while making a call. Motorola should look back at their StarTac phone, which was designed with the holster in mind, and was smaller than the RAZR.Overall not bad, but Motorola (and others) could use a "less is more" approach to their phones.

review/text: WARNING! Before you buy this phone for Verizon, I have to warn you - the picture transfer and mp3/ringtone transfer are disabled. From what I understand, Verizon is the ONLY company that does this, which forces you to use their own service and pay their fees.Their own ad copy in this very item (above) says "It also supports polyphonic ringtones as well as MP3 ringers, allowing you to use portions of your favorite songs to alert you to incoming calls."Yeah. They don't tell you that you can't transfer without using their high-fee data service. With everyone else, you can just connect the phone to a cable.If you want a RAZR phone - do NOT get one from Verizon!

My phone has been hit with over 3000 paintballs, and list goes on.Pros- * It may only be mine but its literally indestructible* Battery for the first six months lasts around over 2 weeks* Fail safe with the battery, that whenever hit to hard or in the wrong way, it comes out. But nly at a set limit of course, and it also only does it for instance when thrown out of a lacrosse stick.Cons- * My sister had one, she ended up running it over, and it destroyed the screen.* Theres only two colors* Battery after six months NEEDS to be replaced for it dies alot.

 review/text: I LOVED this phone. I have had many phones over the years but this one has so far been my absolute favorite. I have always favored Motorola phones over LG ones, but this phone was, oh, just amazing.It was so durable. I lost count how many times I dropped it, and it only had one scratch. I have had my friends complain that its snapped in half on them and other things along those lines, but that never happened to me. I dropped it once and them stepped on it by accident- its still in excellent shape.THe features that were on the phone were great and it was amazing. I only ha done complaint about the phone that was not Motorola's fault. It was actually Verizon's. They took out some of the amazing features it was capable of.Unfortuneatly, the phone's screen got messed up somehow and since it wasnt insured I had to get a whole new phone. I would have bought the same phone again, but they changed the color sceme to the silver on the outside, and it turned me off.Now, I see the new RAZR V9m coming out and it also has amazing features and I cannot wait for that phone again, but once again, my complaint with Verizon stands. Some new features like Crystal Talk that would eliminate the background noise was taken off the phone. I do not know why they are buthering perfectly good phones, but I would still buy it and will very much be happy with it.

 review/summary: Worst phone I ever owned!
 review/text: Well, after reading good reviews about the Razr in various magazines and online I decided that I would get one since I was switching back to Verizon after having Cingular for 3 years, what a mistake!ProsThere really are no good things about this phone, some may like it because it is thin but I did't even like that aspect.ConsThe first problem I noticed with this phone is that it takes FOREVER to turn on. From the time you press the on button till you can make or receive a call is well over 1 minute. Therefore, if you are like me and don't use your cellphone every minute of your life and actually turn it off every once in a while you better hope you don't need to make an emergency call because you will likely be unconscious before this thing turns on. My 3 year old Nokia I had from Cingular turned on and could place a call within 5 seconds, beat that Razr.The second problem is that when you turn the phone off it makes a stupid sound that cannot be turned off or muted and is quite annoying.The thinness of the phone causes your hand to cramp up after about two minutes of use.The display on this phone sucks and is impossible to see in sunlight no matter which way you try to face it. The outer display doesn't even show when the phone is not in use and gets annoying when you try to use it as a clock and have to open it everytime.Battery life is horrible, it lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes for me on a fully charged battery until it died, this is unacceptable in my book.Sound quality is very poor and whenever you talk into it you hear your own voice in the ear part of the phone which gets really annoying after about one minute.Reception is certainly not the best, the Motorola E815 that I got now gets full reception in places that this thing couldn't even find a signal.The interface is ugly and cannot be changed the red verizon bars on the top and bottom need to go and I like Motorolas interface much better.The OK button needs to be changed so that it is raised up or something because everytime you try to hit it you end up hitting one of the arrows instead.So there you have it that is why I didn't like this phone at all and returned it after two days for an E815 which by the way I am more than happy with. If you want a phone that makes and receives calls with good clarity and reception (which is what a phone is designed for) this is definitely not for you. I didn't test bluetooth, speaker, games, vcast, mp3 playing, etc. etc. because personally I could care less about those things and want a phone for a phone which this definitly is not.

 review/summary: I love this phone
 review/text: Problems that some may have had with this phone are just personal ones such as "can't swim with this phone in my pocket", "It's not like my old phone" and such. Other than that, it doesn't get any better than this. The camera is great with good lighting (as with every camera or video camera). The music player is awesome. The interface takes a little getting used to as with any new device you'll buy. Even the internal speaker sounds good unlike most phones. The only cons such as poor reception, or limitations of use are caused by your location or your provider. Verizon makes up for it by their surprisingly excellent customer service. This phone is built like a tank. I love it!

 review/summary: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This phone is a piece of crap!
 review/text: When I first saw this phone I just had to have it. I loved that is was so slick and slim. No antenna was a nice plus as well. I really regret buying this phone!!! My biggest upset was the battery life. The day I recieved the phone I charged it and was ready to go. I made one THIRTEEN MIN phone call and it already needed to be charged. I went two or three days with the same thing happening and I finally took it back to the store. They(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that I would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn't got any better. I only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. I dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. The only upside to this phone is that its slender. I repeat Please Don't Waste Your Money!

 review/summary: May be clich&eacute; these days, but still a great phone
 review/text: I replaced a Motorola v265 with this phone. I was extremely disappointed by the fact that this phone is made of plastic, not metal. The speakerphone is indeed not loud enough; it's quieter than any other speakerphone I've ever heard. The directional pad is too small for my average-sized hands, and requires me to use my fingertips, which is annoying most of the time. The button travel is a bit deep, but I suppose that it prevents accidental pressing.My phone has been hacked as mentioned in other reviews, so I am no longer forced to download ringtone$ and graphic$ from Verizon. Yes, I voided my phone's warranty by doing this, but these phones have been around for years, and they're pretty reliable. I also added a 1GB Micro-SD card, and the phone works fairly well as an MP3 player (playlists are supported). MP3s must be synced from Windows Media Player 10, but it's a very simple process. A standard 5-pin USB cable will allow this phone to interface with a PC.It's best to install a Micro-SD card in this phone with the intention of never removing it. You'll probably damage something while trying. The positive side is that the card will not budge if you drop your phone.The built-in 1.3 megapixel camera compares with my ancient 1.2 megapixel camera. You won't take breathtaking works of art with it, but the picture quality is half-decent. The video camera produces similar webcam-quality results.The real point of this phone is its aesthetic appeal. It's thin enough that you can keep it in your pocket without being bothered by the bulge. It looks good when you pull it out, and the shape and materials feel good when you're using it. It's not cutting-edge anymore, but it costs a lot less than a Blackberry, and if you're willing to hack it (voiding warranty), it provides a satisfying amount of gadgetry.UPDATE: I tried modifying another Razr V3m in an identical fashion. The USB connection was loose, and the phone became disconnected from the computer during the modification. That phone is now a paperweight. Be careful!

 review/summary: Good phone, lousy carrier
 review/text: I've owned my V3m for about 6 months now, and I've had no trouble with it at all. My only complaint is with Verizon. Motorola manufactured a phone that can be hooked up to your computer with a simple USB cord, making it easy to load your own pictures, wallpaper, ringtones, or whatever. Verizon has blocked this ability on the phones they sell! They want you to have to pay them to send pictures to yourself, and to have to buy ringtones. Why should I pay them $2 to $3 each for tiny snippets of songs that I already own, or could buy from iTunes for 99 cents for the whole song?!The phone can be hacked (there are instructions all over the net), but you can fry your phone if you don't hack it properly, and the hacking voids your warranty, so if you're not pretty tech-savvy and you really want this phone, I'd STRONGLY advise that you go with another carrier that doesn't disable the phone's capabilities. If I had known this when I bought my phone, that's what I'd have done, and I will be definitely be switching when my contract is up unless Verizon changes their policies.

 review/summary: a great phone that has been crippled by Verizon
review/text: The V3m is a great phone that Verizon has crippled. The camera can take 1 megapixel images that get locked into your phone unless you subscribe to the optional text and image plan. As others have noted, if you wish to download images directly from the micro sd card, you have to remove the battery to take out the card. You can't download images from the phone with a usb cable.After many hours of trying, I was able to download music using a Windows XP machine with Media Player 10, which I never use for music. I prefer iTunes, but it will not work with this phone. The Verizon interface makes it awkward to use the music features and you will need USB headphones for additional money (again).While my older Motorola phone was able to use Verizon's national access to connect my computer to the internet (14.4k with no additional charge except minutes used, slow but useful), the V3m has disabled this feature and requires you to subscribe to a data plan for... more money (again).In theory, voice dialing will allow you to use a voice command to call any number in the directory. It hasn't been perfected. If you say, "call Mary", the phone is just as likely to call Harry.Although Verizon boasts about their network, this phone has been unable to connect in transportation hubs like New York's Grand Central Terminal and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. Battery life is weak and the ring tones are lame but you can always get new ones from Verizon for... more money (again).It is clear that Verizon has engineered this phone to squeeze every extra dollar out of you that they can. You have an option. You can just say no to the V3m and get an iPhone.

review/summary: Buyer Beware!
 review/text: In a nutshell: Verizon has made this phone mediocre. If you gotta have a V3m, get one from another carrier.The Razr V3m's sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by Verizon's sluggish interface and crippled features. If all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you'll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. But those searching for a "media" rich phone should keep looking.The "IN" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are Verizon subscribers. BUT...If you are at all interested in customizing the V3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the VCAST service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for Windows users).The built-in camera is just okay. With the placement of the lens near the hinge you're bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. The same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you'll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.You can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that's next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there's no 3.5mm headphone port; A USB dongle adapter is in box. Note: the largest card you can use is a 1GB.No USB cable is included despite the V3m's disabled OBEX feature (which allows the transferring of files via bluetooth). Razrs from Sprint, T-Mobile, Cingular an All-Tell have this feature intact!pros:compact sizerespectable sound qualitycan check voicemail from another phonecons:Many important wireless functions disabled! (in favor of paid services)interface can be slow...and always reminds you that you're a Verizon customercannot vibrate AND ring; it's only one or the other.only plays .wma files with no support for iTunes or winamp playlistsmay feel awkward in big handsnighttime starts at 9PM

 review/summary: Lovely phone, poor reception
 review/text: I love this phone: ideal form factor that slips easily into your pocket, great screen, lovely keyboard, works well with Bluetooth. Good set of features.HOWEVER, call quality is fair to poor (in Silicon Valley). I just converted from my $49 LG phone and was hoping for the marvelous Razr experience its owners carry on about. It turns out that when you press them on incoming call quality, they mostly admit that it really isn't that good.So if you're buying this phone with the expectation of using it a lot, then make sure you have a return option. As it is, with some reluctance, I will return mine before my 15-day return window at Verizon Wireless expires. It's a shame, as the rest of the phone is brilliant.

 review/summary: Don't buy without a Battery Upgrade
 review/text: My experience concurs with "Nikki's" assessment in that the battery lifetime is worse than useless. I resent the gross misrepresentations in the above review / Motorola's specs that state this phone offers: "lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 3.33 hours of digital talk time, and up to 325 hours of digital standby time."After 1/2 hr of talking the phone's battery meter shows only 1/3 battery capacity left. By mid afternoon the phone keeps beeping for a recharge, even though all other features except standby are switched off. Even simply leaving it off-charge, in standby mode for most of the day, seems to drain the battery at least 1/2 way on the screen meter.What I resent most is Verizon's pretense there is nothing wrong, or that I should leave it on-charge all the time. Because of this lack of honesty I have wasted time going back to the Verizon office to swap out the battery after a week, and then gone to Verizon again to swap the whole phone a week later.Meantime, I just spent 18 months using one of the original Razr V3s with a GSM carrier. which has excellent battery life. Throughout the whole period I barely ever drained the battery, even after leaving it off-charge on standby throughout most weekends.Think very seriously about insisting Verizon upgrade the battery for free when you buy this phone. Meantime, I'm scrambling to figure what other Verizon phone to switch to before the 15 day no-questions-asked guarantee expires!

Also took it to an indoor pool facility to watch a swim meet once. I understand others have had similar humidity problems too, especially with the Motorola phones.

And trust me there is a hell lot of difference now. I think now I am getting a talk time of ~2.5 hours and standby of ~2 days.I concluded that even though I was living in urban area but while traveling and over week signal spots the phone keeps searching for evdo digital signals along with wireless signals so it consumes twice power, therefore by turning it off you save a lot of power, forgot to mention Motorola has already packed this phone with heavyduty battery! as compared to past razr models.Pros are good reception, and voice clarity.

 review/text: I upgraded to this phone. It has poor battery life on the battery that comes with the phone which is something like 700mah. I found that this did not work for me at all. On a full charge and no calls....it would be down to 1 bar. I took it back thinking it was a defect. Got a new phone and battery....same problem.....So I experimented and put the extended battery in. Charged on Tuesday night...turned on Wednesday morning and left it on thru Sunday where I found that I had still one bar and able to make or recieve calls. I just need to talk and listen...all the other stuff is not necessary for me! The extended battery by the way is 1450mAh or so! I am finding that different people are having different experiences with this phone! Good luck!

 review/text: I've become a big fan of the game "Draw Something" and thought it might be nice to have a stylus to help me draw or write on my Galaxy Nexus phone. This stylus absolutely works on the screen, but I don't think it helps much with my intended purpose. The tip of this stylus is squishy, and for the contact to register on the screen, the tip must be completely squished. You have to press a little harder than feels natural. Also, the tip isn't very fine, so I end up drawing thin lines with the same unpredictability experienced with using a finger. I still like the stylus and perhaps with more practice it will be a superior writing implement.This does come with an audio jack tether, but the cord is too short to keep the stylus attached while using it on the screen. It's still nice to have to keep the stylus with the phone in your purse or pocket.I love the long length and slim line of this stylus. Mimics writing with a pen or pencil.

 review/text: Only let AT & T give you this phone if:--you would rather not be bothered by irritating calls--you prefer to charge your phone every single day--you prefer to receive messages and texts several hours after they are sent.--you like having really small buttons, making texting difficult--you would rather not have information from voice mails available on screen--you have to actually listen to the voice mail just to find out who called!!!That's right, this is the cell phone that while fully charged sends calls right to voice mail while turned on, then informs you of a missed call hours later. I have had two of them and am battling AT & T to get something else. The worst thing is that, despite its obvious flaws, if you are a light user you don't realize the missed calls thing is the a phone issue until you've had it for a while.Additionally, changing the volume on the speaker is a challenge--you can only do it while a call is in session and it is a very small button on the side of the phone--no setting on disk; you cannot see incoming caller id without opening the phone; the battery life is pathetically short; and the camera is utterly worthless.This phone would have been a stellar performer in, say, 1985. Now it just sucks, out loud.

I had a Sony Ericsson Z520a for two years until I waterlogged it while washing my car.

The battery life issue doesnt bother me because I plug it in to charge every night while I sleep. I've never had a battery issue, and I am a young woman, I talk A LOT and text a lot. Texting is easy on this phone. The light effects are not stupid looking like I am in highscool or anything, in fact I like them because I can see from across the room if I want to talk to the person or not (that's how I prioritize the lighting :-)One thing it doesnt do is video, which my other Sony did. Doesn't matter because I don't use it anyway. One thing it DOES do that my other one didnt, it alerts me when I get a new email on my main email address, which I only use for close friends so that is a huge plus.

 review/summary: Good basic phone w/cool lighting effects, but bad battery life and reception.
 review/text: I got the Sony310a because I wanted a basic phone and I thought the lighting effects were pretty cool. However, after owning for almost a year it hasn't always been smooth sailing, here are the pros and cons:Pros:+ Lighting effects are very cool and customizable. You can choose many colors including: pink, red, blue, green, purple, white, and yellow to color code your contacts when they call you.+ Themes - There are many themes to choose and download, and you can customize your theme so it changes automatically to another theme at a certain time.+ Basic features - This phone has good basic features, including calculator, the ability to set reminders and alarms, conversion program, games (ace of spades and quadra pop), bluetooth, infrared, RSS feeds, mobile internet, and email.+ Durability and Appearance - This phone is very durable. I have dropped it many times and it has not broken on me yet. The appearance of the phone is also professional looking, even though its a budget phone. It also has light up icons on the front display that tell you if you have any messages or missed calls.Cons:- Bad camera quality - The phone has a VGA camera, but even for VGA its not very good quality even with good lighting. I have had two phones with VGA before this one, and even their camera quality was better.- Bad reception - The phone does not have the greatest reception. Even though I live in a dead zone, with my old Nokia phone I was still able to get good reception. With the Sony I am lucky if I get 1 bar. And for some reason when I get calls or text messages they don't show up on my phone until hours or even a day after they were sent to my phone. This can be quite an annoyance. I also get bad reception with mobile internet. For some reason I am not always to connect even when I have reception.- Bad battery life - The battery life is pretty bad. I have to recharge the phone almost every night.- Bad call quality - This phone also does not have the best call quality on both ends. I constantly hear static or garbling.While this phone is a budget phone, you do get what you pay for. If you are looking for a phone with good mobile internet, reception, and all the fancy features then you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a budget phone with basic features and cool lighting effects then I would recommend this phone. You can get this phone for free at AT&T; and it would be perfect for a teenager who just needs basic calling and text features with cool lighting effects.

 review/summary: i love this phone
review/text: it's 2012 & i just dug this phone back out to start using again. i've had 2 upgrades since & haven't liked either as much as i like this phone. i dropped it in water in 2009. the whole phone still works except for the microphone. i just plug in a hands free set & use that mic so it works. i liked the speaker feature but the hands free set works fine for calls. doesn't have 4g. as far as i'm concerned cell screens are too small for any relevant internet use. i certainly don't have to worry about anyone stealing this phone. it's solid, compact & feels good in your hand. i love the selection of themes, colors, & ringers on the phone. i love that the lights alert you to a call if the ringer is turned off so it's not disturbing if you are in a situation where you can't take a call - don't have to have an annoying vibration sound on to know someone called. even volume 1 is quiet enough that you can personally be alerted to a call without disturbing others. i always get my free phone upgrade as soon as it is available so i have a stash of phones & chips to rely on if my current phone is incapacitated. i like to get sony ericcson so i can keep a the same battery charging in an old phone & ready to replace every day anyway. i haven't liked either of the 2 phones i've had since as well as i like this phone. when i dug this phone out, i decided i'm going back to using it with the auxiliary mic. i'm considering buying another one.

review/summary: OK...
 review/text: I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. It had held up very well, considering. It is easy to use and has some pretty cool features. The camera pictures normally turn out pretty good. But I was hoping for pre-progammed games, and it had none. It is also pretty fat. If you wear it in your pocket with jeans, you can really see it. I tried to spice it up a little with rhinestones. I kinda wish I hadn't bought this phone. I wouldn't really recommend this phone, but if you want an eay-to-use phone, this one at least works.

 review/text: This beautiful little phone deserves five stars for looks, including body, screens, tones and fonts. However it is so smoothly rounded it can be hard to flip open easily. It slips into a pocket like a bar of soap and can disappear in the laundry. Unfortunately it did not survive a soaking of only a few seconds.

 review/text: I purchased this phone for use with my current cell phone service. The phone was very nice, however, my cell phone provider told me that I could not use this phone with their service since I didn't purchase it from them. When I inserted my SIM card, it said "Inactive SIM card". I had to return the phone and purchase it from my provider. That being said, the phone works very nicely and has a lot of nice features, however, the one thing I don't like is the short battery life. I don't use my phone all that much, but I need to charge it every night if I am going to use it the next day.

 review/summary: Shoddy construction and inaccurate picture.
 review/text: Recently, I've been having problems with charging my Samsung N400 phone. I have a charger with a single prong that fits into the phone base. Unfortunately, the socket of my phone is rather loose and sometimes the charger doesn't make a connection.I purchased this charged because the picture showed a multi-pin plug to fit in the alternate interface on my phone. I required this interface since my single prong socket was loose/damaged. The charger I received does not match this picture as it has the traditional single prong. Granted, it does work for the Samsung N400, but doesn't match the product picture so in a sense was falsely advertized.Secondly, the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter has a lead post that is sprint loaded. This ensures it makes contacts with the cigarette lighter recepticle. However, this lead post presses into the charger head and does not spring out; it sticks. In other words, it doesn't make contact with the cigarette lighter socket and therefore doesn't conduct electricty to charge my phone.False or inaccurate advertizing coupled with shoddy construction left me very disappointed with this purchase.I would not recommend this product.

I threw them out and bought the (mroe expensive) Palm brand "Anti-Glare screen protectors" and am elated. It was easy to apply and you can clear the fingerprints off of them. The Palm ones were more expensive but a much better product - I've had the same one on my Treo for 7 months now and don't see why I'd ever need to replace it.

review/summary: Sufficient Protection But ...
 review/text: Palm Treo 700p ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen ProtectorThis product cannot support some of its selling points. Based on my experience over the past 6 months, I replaced it once on my Treo 700p because it did not fulfill the following claims: Dust-repelling, Fingerprint Free, Improves Handwriting Recognition. And the sensitivity of the touchscreen was inhibited by the screen. It does protect the Treo touchscreen from scratches and is completely washable and reusable. But application even with the supplied applicator does not easily flatten out the air bubbles when applying to the Treo. The screen is a dust magnet and natural oils from your fingers cannot easily be wiped off. So, once applied, the dust and fingerprints are visible to the naked eye. I expect much improvement over the next year if I am to purchase this again. Hence, I only give two out of 5 stars to the Boxwave anti-glare screen protector.

 review/text: This phone was to be my stand by phone until Iphone releases its 3G version, but I feel I will keep it until the end of my contract. It serves my purpose- Making calls . good call quality,audible,no issues with signal and reception. Got 1 bar when I was in elevator and call did not get disconnected.- Battery life . I allow it to discharge almost to 5% then charge itback to 100%. Battery stays for 2 days with minimal usage and close to day and half with lot of usage (only calls, no browsing).- Appearance and interface is very much improved and looks good.I have been a loyal amazon customer for close to two years, had no issues with any of my orders. On time delivery.Some issues I had were- Transferring phone book. Used a software from internet to transfer from my contacts from Outlook to Phone memory.- No CD or handsfree along with the product. Need to get itseperately.- very glossy, so need to clean it sometimes to remove fingerprints.All in all a really good phone with required features.

It syncs easily to your (Windows) computer through mini-USB.Bad: slow interface, and while you can access the microSD/transflash through USB (to upload/download mp3s, videos, games and pictures) you can't easily access the phone's 60GB (it can be done with third party programs but is not recommended.)Good: it comes with java games, and it's quite easy to add more games by moving them to the microSD/transflash.Bad: the games that come with it are crippled.

 review/summary: Very powerful, versatile phone
review/text: For years, ever since the "old school" days, my cell phone of choice was always a Nokia until about three years ago, when I opted to upgrade to a Motorola v551. While overall, the v551 was a nice phone, there were some Motorola quirks that really soured me on considering a new Motorola device.So, when the time came again to upgrade my device, I started to do some real reserach to find an all around good phone. I considered waiting for the new iPhone, but couldn't see plunking down $600 on a non-3G capable phone (first generation to boot). Nokia's were out simply because many of them are not flip phones and even the ones that are weren't aesthetically pleasing. Compounding my problem even further was the fact that even though the RAZR's looked nice, I read way too many reviews that highlighted its many shortcomings. And, it was a Motorola, plagued with the same quirks that I had hated (one example, the fact that I had to create a separate contact for every phone number I entered, even if it was for the same person, another was photo quality and yet another was the charger.)After reading the reviews for the V3xx, I was intrigued. For one, Motorola revamped its operating system, making it more user friendly. Secondly, the v3xx was 3G capable, had a powerful camera, and could be used as an MP3 device. These were the things I was looking for, and after reading the reviews, I figured I'd give Motorola another chance.I've had the phone for three days now and I'm very pleased. It has a nice sturdy feel to it, the buttons and "joystick" are easily used and feel solid. The display is very sharp, it takes great photos and has a few photo tools to help make your picture look good. The reception is also very good and phone calls sound crystal clear. The speakerphone is average, sounding just like most speaker phones do (like a tin can.) The internet browser, with the 3G capability, is great and I can actually see myself using the media features as opposed to having it simply as a novelty like I did on the v551. The streaming video and music is great and I hope that Cingual expands the selection of titles as well as length of programming.I still have yet to try the mobile e-mail function and the mp3 player, but I don't have any doubts that they will perform well also. To be a semi-serious mp3 player, a micro SD card is essential, as well as either a bluetooth hedaset or a 3.5mm adapter.Perhaps the only gripe I can come up with at this time is the outside display is not as bright as it could be, and I find myself having to look very hard to see what time it is or whether I had missed a call. On the v551, the display would light up bright blue and even when dimmed, the time was still easy to see during the day.To sum up, if you're considering a phone that that doesn't require serious business use, give the V3xx a try. I'm very pleased with my purchase.

review/summary: had high hopes
 review/text: I really had high hopes for this phone. Previously I had a cingular v3 for 2 years and couldn't have been happier with that phone. So, in looking for a new phone, naturally I went with the v3xx because of the 3g network, new screen, sd slot, and all the new features. Everything was great with the phone, screen is awesome, data transfer is quick, phone looks great, but I could not get over the most important thing in a phone: call quality.Experienced terrible reception with this phone, numerous dropped calls, and being in downtown L.A., I'm not sure of the reason. I'm on my second unit and still experienced the same issues. Dropped calls + voice distortion to the point where i was asking people to repeat certain words several times a minute. I suspect it mostly occured when the phone was switching from 3G to Edge, or vice versa as I experienced the worst reception and call quality when I noticed the network icon switching back and forth. Needless to say, I'll be returing this to amazon, perhaps looking to another carrier and settling with edge network, instead of 3g. I see other people are completely happy with this phone, so I guess reception and phone quality greatly varies, and maybe my gripe is more with the network than the phone as everything else with the phone was excellent.

 review/summary: Not quite what I hoped for
 review/text: I have changed to GSM and selected the V3xx phone as the Motoroal V60 was the best phone I have ever owned. The Razr V3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about. First of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference. The front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller ID. Both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight. The srceens are great in reduced light or indoors. The start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the AT&T browser or CV both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving. I have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving. I have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices. The best is the Motorola H700 (I bought it from Amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99.00 asked by AT&T). The H700 is scratchy but usable in a car. The quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices I have tried is about equal to the built in speaker. The last issue with the phone is battery life, if I am lucky I get two days charge on a battery. I probably place or receive four to five short calls a day. Sometimes I run out of battery on the second day, so now I just plug the phone in each night. My old phones Nokias, Motorolas, and Panasonics (all digital not GSM) lasted between one or two weeks on a charge. I guess I'll have to adjust to the new technology!

 review/summary: Great phone, make the leap to this Razr its worth it
 review/text: I have used Nokia from day 1, but I decided to try this Razr, because I had heard that Motorola fixed a lot of the problems that the original Razr had. This phone has great reception, brilliant screen, awesome camera for pictures, bluetooth works very well with hands free link in my car and very easy to text with. I haven't downloaded music yet so can't comment on that aspect. This phone is also very nice looking I must admit.The only problem is the ringtones that come with this phone are awful, they force you to go buy ringtones which I think is absurd. Great phone otherwise, highly recommended.

 review/summary: Got this phone on a second try....
 review/text: When I first went in the store to upgrade my phone, I got talked into getting a LG CU500. I liked the features of the phone but did not like how it handled my calls, (went silent for a minute or two alot during calls). So I took it back and got a Razr v3xx since I have had a Motorola phone in the past and it got great service, not to mention that I did some research and alot of people seem to really like them as well, (online reviews and friends referral). I have to say that this is a really nice phone and I haven't had ANY problems with it at all so far and I've had it now for 2 weeks. So I'm super happy with it and glad I traded the other one in for this.

 review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM AMAZON (or any other phone)
 review/text: My boyfriend bought this phone for me from Amazon and it was the worst idea ever! First, when I got the phone it couldn't be activated due to technical problems (due to Amazon, not AT&T;). I called Amazon for assistance, and they forwarded me to their cell phone department who said 1) they didn't know what the problem was, 2) there was no one else that I could speak to, and 3) they would email (NOT call) me back. Amazon gave me the run-around for over two weeks. Finally, i took the phone into an AT&T; store. They informed me that is was most definitely a REFURBISHED phone. They also told me the reason there were so many problems activating the number is because the phone number BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE! I called Amazon to discuss the fact they had sent me a refurbished phone when I had bought a NEW phone, and they did not have an answer. The very nice customer service representative said that he would have someone email me back (because the cell phone specialty department did NOT make any calls). It's been two weeks and I still do not have an explanation as to why I was sent a refurbished phone or why I was assigned a number which was already assigned to someone else.DO NOT buy phones from Amazon. Although you pay less for the phone, it's not worth it!!! Just go it the store and deal directly with the cell phone company.

 review/summary: Poor quality, pooer service
 review/text: The phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a "dot" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.

 review/summary: AT&T Lies about Dropped Calls but phone is not problem
 review/text: I was talked into this phone when I almost used my old Motorola as a hockey puck when it "spontaneously died" along with 2 other Cingular customers who also had the Motorola V557- Our phones just powered off and would not power on, and we were all within a month of contract end and planning to go to Nextel. However, the phone has performed well. Battery life could be more like I was led to expect, but it is ok. It charges best if turned off, and the camera (not a critical accessory) is phenomenal, sometimes outperforming my wife's digital. However my carrier is still big disappointment.

 review/summary: Cool design with some "need to get used to" features
 review/text: I definitely like the phone for it's slender design and features. the only thing that gets me is getting used to actually using the phone. trying to make sense of call history, or to quickly access some of your items can be trying for someone who is not as tech savvy with cell phones. i enjoy the phone and it does what it supposed to do very well... make and receive calls!clear audio quality, no dropped calls so far and a HUGE screen to see things. after reading the guide and sitting down with the phone for an hour or two and re-programming it,... it's a lot more user-friendly. it's as good as any other phone for text msgs.good battery life and if looking for accessories, definitely look for a snug holster to avoid this phone from feeling loose in its case. You can also find good accessories at Radioshack.

review/text: This is an amazing piece of equipment. I have used the RAZR V3 for 2 years. This is only that much better. Bright screen. Brillient Graphics. Fast operating system. Huge memory. Decent camera. Quantum improvement over the original RAZR v3The downside: Cingular has replaced the functional "Mail" button with their "Video" button. I own a phone to talk and text. Cingular wants you to watch "Video" ($10.00/minute without plan). Push that button by mistake and it will be a very expensive day.A fantastic phone by Motorola undone by Cingular's "Marketing" department.Can't wait to purchase an unlocked, unhijacked version of this incredible phone.

review/summary: Awesome after an easy hack
 review/text: I've had a non-3G RAZR for a couple years, and recently upgraded to this. Coupled with an unlimited data plan, this is an absolutely stellar phone.Users of past RAZR and similar Motorola phones almost won't recognize the OS. It's been hugely improved in almost every area - camera, media, address book, messaging, storage (including a a Transflash slot). It's also very snappy. Hardware-wise, the screen is bumped from the old 176x220 to 240x320 (QVGA). It's silky smooth and bright.If you live in a Cingular 3G area, the HSDPA data is amazingly fast, and the voice quality is orders of magnitude better than any cell phone I've tried before - crystal clear. The built in browser is okay, but it really shines with the free Opera Mini browser.The only disappointing thing is that Cingular has crippled the network access for Java applications. Using a non-Cingular Java application such as Opera Mini will have the phone asking your permission to access the network every single network request it makes. This gets really frustrating really fast, but a fix can be found with a little bit of googling.Don't bother with this if you don't get the data plan... get a KRZR instead... many of the OS improvements are included.

 review/summary: Razr V3xx is the best Razr phone availble.
 review/text: The V3xx excels so much more than any other razor phone. The V3xx has a 247mhz Arm9 process which the V3/V3i/V3r only have a 40mhz processor, V3x 70mhz,Krazr K1 only has a 66mhz processor. Also the V3xx has more built in memory than any other previous Razr phones with 60Mb expandable w/ upto 2GB SD. Another note the V3xx has the Nvidia Goforce 4800GPU which is great for the gamer. I had much faster framerates on my Java games. The Goforce 4800 also conserves battery life when you are not using the phone. I had the V3r razr and the batter drained much faster. The V3xx comes with the best screen so far with 240x320 Qvga screen. The old Qcif screens just do not look this good it is amazing. V3xx is a HDSPA 3G phone one of the only ones that cingular provides. It is much faster than the old GPRS/Edge/UMTS formats and allows for faster data downloads. Streaming video, and audio is also availble which is a great feature. The video camera is very good and supports full screen playback. Lastly the phone supports A2DP stereo bluetooth 2.0 support.Only drawbacks of the phone are the camera 1.3MP the Goforce chip supports upto 3MP and Motorola should of done that. Still most razr phones only have VGA or 1.2MP. Another drawback is the buttons ofcourse this is something common amongst all razr phones.Pluses +Qvga 240x320 display 256,000 color3G HSDPA (video streaming, music streaming, faster data rates)Fastest GPU of all Razr phonesIncreased Memory and upgradabilityGoforce 4800 GPUOpera web browsingMpeg4 (256kb/s), WMV (128kb/s), H.264, 3GP supportFull Screen videoMidp2.0 Java Game supportA2DP Stereo Bluetooth 2.0 SpecUSB mini jack

 review/summary: Best phone out there!
 review/text: Prior to purchasing this phone, I had used a wide variety of other phones from Cingular with having settled on the V551 for a while and then even upgrading to a Palm Treo 650 since I wanted easier to use options of email, internet, text messaging and mp3 player all in one. Well after the Palm got old and I wasnt using as much as I thought I would and with the extra weight of the Palm, I decided to buy a v3xx after reading all the reviews.I just cant say enough about this phone! Some of the great features I've noticed just in the few days since Ive had it:1. Great clarity and reception2. Just beautiful phone3. I can finally listen to songs via bluetooth! I couldnt even do this with my Treo! I always had to either listen through the phone itself or through a corded earpeice.4. Convienent options menu for the most popular menu options such as turning on bluetooth, music player, etc. No need to go scrolling through pages and pages of menus to get what you need.5. Lightning fast download speeds! Even with my Treo, it would take forever for a webpage to load. This Razr loads within seconds!I'm sure this phone has many other great features that I havent found yet, but these are the most impressive ones. I have yet to find a negative about this phone. I cant believe I was able to get everything I used on my PDA into this much smaller phone with faster speeds and better options!Anyone looking to buy this phone, do not hesitate. Its fantastic. So worth the extra cost!

My last (Samsung) phone had very poor sound quality and was often unusable. This one is awesome. The sound quality is superb, even in places that used to give me trouble with other phones.

 review/summary: Great phone, minor changes, only tri-band
 review/text: I recently got this phone thinking it was quad-band since that is what Amazon advertises. However I checked some websites and found out Amazon is mis-advertising and this is actually only a tri-band GSM 850/1800/1900.Although Motorola downgraded this aspect of the phone, you should still be able to use the phone in most countries (after having it unlocked) since services that run on GSM 900 also run on 1800 I think.Overall, having previously used a RAZR V3, I love this new V3xx.1) Camera is now 1.3 MP (compared to the V3's 0.3 MP), however, 2 MP would have been better.2) Screen is significantly sharper and the graphics are improved.3) Phonebook allows for multiple numbers per entry.4) External keys are now silent, so if you have previously used Motorola phones, you will find this a blessing; you no longer will be embarrassed when changing your ringer setting.Some more upgrades include:5) A cap for the mini-usb port to keep out the dust.6) When looking through your address book, you can now press multiple letters instead of just one--a definite time-saver and a given in Nokia phones.7) The '#' key now allows you to change your ringer setting to vibrate by holding it down for a second. Another hold will change your ringer back to the previous setting.8) The V3xx seems to save more battery by dimming and turning off both the external and internal screens much more quickly than the V3.9) For Sudoku lovers out there--yep, that game is on this phone. Although some features are disabled (such as Solver mode, Tutorial, or higher levels), there are no restrictions on playing 'Easy' level games.I would recommend this phone to everyone, especially previous RAZR and Motorola owners. The V3xx has a processor at least 4x faster than any previous Motorola phone. This means there is no longer a lag after pressing a button.

 review/summary: easy to use even for me
 review/text: I upgraded an old phone to a Sync just three days ago; at the same time, my son got a Razr v3xx. In comparing the two phones, several things about the Razr prompted me to go back and exchange the Sync.The Razr keeps a subdued clock on the outside screen at all times; the Sync does not.The Razr is much easier to open with one hand.The Razr has voice-dial; the Sync does not.The Razr seems to have a cleaner sound for calls.The Razr is simply easier for me - an almost 40-something with no technical skills - to figure out. The screen icons are cleaner and the menus are more intuitive. I had the Sync for three days and still could not figure out half the stuff I wanted to. I've had the Razr for 3 hours and have already set it up the way I want it, including locking myself out of those expensive Media Net buttons. There's even a way to lock the AT&T; Music feature, but keep the ability to use the music player, which is in that menu, by making the music player one of the Navigation keys.Plus, the Razr is just prettier!The only thing I can think of that I don't like about the Razr is that the speaker does not sound very crisp at all. If you listen to music, I recommend headphones.Update June 2011 - I'm still using this phone, and it's still awesome. It never quits. My son has the same phone (he's now 17) and neither of us are easy on phones. It's simple, intuitive, light, and the battery life is still days long (we've never replaced the batteries.) If mine ever dies, it'll be a tough decision whether to upgrade to an iphone or just get another Razr...

The reception is much better and the battery lasts three times as long.5) This RAZR accepts a removable micro SD card, so you can store many songs, pictures, videos, etc.6) Playing songs from the MP3 player on the phone itself, even without a headset, is very clear.Overall, a very reliable phone and worth the money. Although the LG had nice features and good image, I need a phone that I can reliably make a phone call with and the RAZR is a much better phone.

 review/summary: Best Motorola phone I ever had.
 review/text: Ok, Im goin to start by saying that over the past year, I had the SLVR L7 (Great MP3 phone) Sony Ericsson W600i (Best phone with stereo speakers) Samsung Blackjack (Ok Internet phone)Well I just got this phone yesterday and I had been using it for over 4 hours and I think from all of the phones, the Motorola V3xx is the best because I didnt have to buy any accesories for it since it uses the same accesories that the Slvr uses. When I first open the box and saw the phone shining, I was amaze because if you see in the pictures, the phone doesnt shine and if it does, its not as realistic as it should be.I put my blackjack's micro SD card and I turn on the phone and all my songs was recognize by the v3xx, Before i bought this phone I was wondering weather if you listen to the songs in the phone and close the lid of the phone if the music would stop but No it didn't. When you close the lid, in the litle display, it tells you the song and the artist and you dont need to open the phone to change songs. With the side buttons, you can change volume and songs.But the best thing that this phone offers is the BASS feature. Whenever you are listening to the songs, (go to options and select music options) there you an control the bass feature. It sounds good if you have the 3.5mm motorola adapter. (you can get it in amazon for 5.00$) I would say that this phone is way better than the krzr because this one have 3G and its fast. If you have a laptop, all you have to buy is the bluetooth adapter and use the phone as a modem, you DO NOT need the USB cable, although you could use it.Overall this is a great phone, Camera is good (WAY better than the razr V3). The reason why I return the blackjack was because the battery suck, and I realize that I didnt need a PDA phone. The speaker is pretty loud although if it was stereo it would it had a better sound but this phone doesn't need another speaker. This phone has everything you need on a phone. The internet browser is really good. I can even go to [...] and browse everything as I did with the blackjack.If you are a teenager or someone that needs a phone for calls and a lil more. Than I recommend this phone. This summer im goin to Puerto Rico and im goin to see if I can use it there. 3G is available in PR so im sure that I wont have any problems. If you have a ? just post it in here and I try to answer it.Hope is helpful. I'll be adding more updates as I use this phone.

 review/text: This phone is definitely a beginner phone. If you just want this phone simply for phone calls, then this phone is for you. But if you want a phone that has a good quality camera, takes videos, and etc. this phone is DEFINTELY not for you. This phone doesn't even have the video feature on it.Oh and the battery life absolutely sucks!The only good thing about this phone is the cool lighting features. THAT'S IT.

 review/summary: Low-end hardware, some good features added.
 review/text: The SonyEricsson Z-series, and some of the T-series, are their lowest-cost models. They typically have shorter battery life than the K- or W-series models, slower processors, and lower sound quality (but still OK). On the up side, they are often a little fancier-looking. The z310 is typical in those areas.I think the z310 is OK, but I was more satisfied with the w200, so I will compare this phone to that.Email client:- I really like having this, and not all low-end phones include it. The w200 has it as well. Email pictures and sounds to friends instead of using MMS (which will degrade them into smaller files).- It's not instant email delivery like a Blackberry, but it is faster to check than using a web-based email page.RSS reader:- It's integrated with the browser and messaging menu, and can update automatically. On this phone, it can basically only handle headlines, while better models can load a couple sentences or even a paragraph of the update. I guess it is afraid of using up memory. I don't think any other low-price phones have this at all.- The w200 does not have the RSS reader integrated, it's a Java application that has to be "opened", so the z310 actually wins here.Display:- Pretty good for STN type. 128x160.- It's about the same as the w200.Outer display:- Hard to see in the sun. Limited area for displaying info, and various icon alerts disappear after a while. The w200's main display is better for checking the time.Menu:- The menu looks pretty good. It appears to be the same setup as the w200, which is pretty good. An improvement over previous z-series models.- On both phones, the main screen conveniently includes the time of your next alarm, as well as any running timers.Sound:- Both the ringer and the earpiece are loud enough to be good, but have a slight muffle at the high end. The w200 doesn't ring quite as loud, but sounds a little clearer.Battery life:- SonyEricsson rates the z310 at 7 hours talk, 300 standby. The w200 is 7 hours talk, and I think 370 standby. It seems like a bigger difference than that, so I wouldn't recommend the z310 if you make a lot of calls. Previous z-series, as well as the older t290, also fell well short of the battery claims. The w200 seems to do a lot better.Java applications:- Opera Mini and Google Maps, which I consider the two most useful Java applications, both run in their most recent, full-featured versions.- However, now and then when I try to download a file from a website using Opera, the z310 will tell me it can't handle that without closing a Java application (ie, Opera Mini). The w200 seems to handle it OK.Media files:- It can play MP3, MIDI, and even AMR (mainly only good for voice notes).- It can display standard graphic file formats, including PNG which many phones can't use. I prefer PNG for phone graphics (and any other application) because it can be converted and resized with much less noise and artifacts.- It can't play 3GP videos. It doesn't just lack the recording ability, but can't play them either. It doesn't have much memory to be recording or downloading videos, but it would be nice if you could at least watch a short clip a friend sends in MMS. The w200 can record and play video.- Any sound file can be selected for ringers, alarms, or message alerts. Other SonyEricsson and Nokia models also do this, but many Samsungs only allow new ringers to be downloaded.Organizer features:- All the standard stuff--calendar, tasks, notes, timers and stopwatch, calculator, converter.- It also has a voice memo, but as SonyEricsson often does it has been placed under the Entertainment menu for some silly reason.Camera:- Common cheap VGA (aka 640x480, aka 0.3 megapixels) on both the z310 and w200.Memory:- 14MB. The w200 has 156.EDGE data speed:It isn't as fast as a lot of other EDGE phones, and it doesn't have a huge amount of memory for downloading things anyway. Even though the w200 only has GRPS, normally a good deal slower, the z310 is not providing as much of a benefit from EDGE as other phones do.Keypad:The keypad on the z310 is not so great. It's a layer of plastic/rubber stuff over the metal contact plates, and my fingers give out faster than with the w200's proper button setup.The z310 isn't terrible overall, and I will probably use it for a while until I get bored with it. But if I had to use just one phone, I would rather have the w200.

review/text: I've had this phone for under a year. It has some great features for sure! I really liked the pink color and I am over 30. From the begining, everyone I spoke to on the phone said they could not hear me unless I spoke loudly into the bottom of the phone which was quite annoying esspecially in public. Then one day no one could hear me at all. I tried everything including reseting the phone, nothing worked. I am now in the market for a new phone in less than a year, what a waste.

review/summary: Complete piece of garbage
 review/text: Only let AT & T give you this phone if:--you would rather not be bothered by irritating calls unless your phone is 100% charged--you prefer to charge your phone every single day--you prefer to receive messages and texts several hours after they are sent--you like having really small buttons, making texting difficult--you would rather not have information from voice mails available on screen--you have to actually listen to the voice mail just to find out who called!!!That's right, this is the cell phone that while fully charged sometimes sends calls right to voice mail while turned on, then informs you of a missed call hours later; this issue increases in frequency when not 100% charged. I have had two of them and am battling AT & T to get something else. The worst thing is that, despite its obvious flaws, if you are a light user you don't realize the missed calls thing until you've had it for a while.Additional problems: changing the volume on the speaker is a challenge--you can only do it while a call is in session and it is a very small button on the side of the phone--no setting on disk; you cannot see incoming caller id without opening the phone; the battery life is pathetically short; and the camera is utterly, totally worthless.This phone would have been a stellar performer in, say, 1985. Now it just sucks. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion about it "not" being "terrible overall," I think that yes, it is indeed terrible, overall and every other possible way.

 review/text: My mom and I both tried this phone. My husband tried it in black. All three of us had problems both sending and receiving calls. Half the time it didn't even register that we had missed a call. Other times it took us directly to voicemail without alerting that caller that they were being called. Tried Sony's recommendations--downloading updates via a usb cable sony sent, and a new charger. Tried AT&T's recommendation to "Turn it off while you shower and then turn it back on afterwards so it can receive updates from the tower." Nothing helped. I guess you get what you pay for--this was the free phone offered by AT&T when we set up our plan.

 review/text: These work to charge your phone, but the casing around part that plugs into the phone is slightly wide, causing the plug to fall out of the phone easily. This is especially aggravating with the car charger. I think it's worth the money to get the better fitting items from Samsung.Also - why does Samsung change the plug in each phone model? The BlackJack 1 and Blackjack 2 do not use interchangeable plugs and my wife's Samsung flipphone uses a completely different connection. Are they trying to make money on peripherals and chargers?

 review/text: The case is a vinyl/rubber cover. Nothing wrong with that, I just thought it was described as plastic. 2 issues. The case does not have a great fit. it seems the case was formed a little small and an edge sticks up (like if you were to pull something too tight). 2nd problem is the cut-out for the camera. If you use a flash, the case can cause some interference and cause the picture to look foggy. However this can be adjusted to not cause a problem. For $20 though, I was expecting a better quality case. It is nice overall and I believe it will hold up over time, I just would not buy again.

 review/text: I bought it because I wanted something lightweight, see-through, and not too bulky. This fits the bill. And I have dropped the phone without any problems, so it's sufficiently protective. My one issue is that it doesn't fit that well - the bottom left corner slides down, so it's always a little lopsided. And the case yellows with time, so it's not as clear after continued use. It does a lot of what I want, but it's not perfect.

 review/summary: Problem With This One
 review/text: I purchased two of these in June '01, and BOTH were dead as a doornail by Sept '01. I use an Ericsson charger that doesn't allow overcharging and I conditioned the battery each month - which means that they were dead after the 3nd conditioning. Neither would charge back up after they had been discharged. In fairness to Ericsson, I have to say that their warranty service is SUPERLATIVE. They sent me upgrade replacement batteries, no shipping charges, within one week. Ericsson gets five stars but this particular battery gets one.

 review/text: I thought I finally found the perfect cell phone accessory - a battery with a belt clip; not one of those cheap after-market kits that are sold everywhere.My only dissapointment was in finding out that while the clip worked great, the battery wouldn't hold a charge.Let's see if the replacement works better.Stay tuned . . .

 review/summary: call it a one year plus (maybe) battery
 review/text: I bought the LX700 phone in Feb 2000. I charge the battery about once a week, and about once a month I discharge it completely using a pair of 10 watt resistors, then recharge. Complete discharge is recommended in the instructions, and the deluxe charger does it automatically. But I just discharged it this week (Aug 2001)and it won't recharge. It is deader than hammer. So it lasted one year and 6 months, which means it probably went through around 80-100 charges. What may be a year and a half for me may be only a few months for you big-shots that talk all the time. It is also overpriced..., but all batteries are.

review/text: I have had my Ericsson phone with this battery for over one year. I have never had any trouble with the battery (or the phone) in that time. The battery has never failed to charge and has charged in a very short period of time. I would highly recommend both the Ericsson battery and phone.

 review/summary: For longer lasting battery, use Lithium-ion.
 review/text: I own a Nokia 5i60 phone, and use it quite often. When I bought this phone, it came with NiMH battery. This battery does not last long, so I bought a longer lasting Lithium-ion battery. With the NiMH battery, I had to recharge once every two weeks using it average of 15 minutes talk per day. Using the Litium-ion battery, I don't have to recharge until over two months. I recommend this battery to those big-time talker using Nokia phones. it's better to replace your NiMH battery with Lithium-ion.

 review/summary: Long lasting but heavy
 review/text: I got this battery for my Nokia 5165 after my NiMH battery started to fade. Oddly enough, the extended lithium battery is less expensive than the regular (and I assume, slimmer) lithium battery, so I bought the cheaper one with more power, which is helpful when you forget to charge your phone. The charge does last a lot longer, but my phone now weighs a ton. That's the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.

 review/summary: BLS-4 - Performance Not Up to Par with Specifications!
 review/text: The BLS-4 came with my Nokia phone and the battery break-in period was followed as directed in owner's manual. However, after about 12 months the battery started showing signs of failing to hold a full charge. The BLS-4 will not hold a full charge for more than two days with only minimum use. The battery must have a limit on recharging cycles. I own another Nokia phone and it too has the BLS-4 battery, bought at the same time as the one noted above. This battery is still holding a full charge. I also followed the same break-in period as directed with this battery, the only difference in the two batteries is that this battery has not been recharged as much as the first. Maybe the first BLS-4 was defective. The battery worked well when it was new.

 review/summary: Bah, get something else!
 review/text: I had the standard battery that came with the Nokia's 5185, that would barely last 36 hours while being on during that entire time. I got the 1500mAh Lithium-Ion so it would last longer than the 36 hours of always being on. It seems as though it doesn't want to last but 40-44 hours of always on and that is without zero usuage of phone calls/recieve, just on and sitting idle. But now if you turn it off for times that you know it won't be used at all then the time goes to 3 or 4 days before recharge. I'll be keeping it for that reason, but if I test the orginial one and last that long before a recharge then this thing blows......

 review/summary: Does the job, but not forever
 review/text: It adds a bit of weight and it could vibrate with a bit more &quot;oomph&quot;, as mentioned by other reviewers. But it does get the job done. My one concern is that I've had this battery for about two years, and it no longer seems to hold a charge for very long. I drain it and discharge it frequently, but I still can't seem to get it to last more than a day or two, even with light usage.Am I asking too much of a NiMH battery to expect it to work like new for more than a couple of years? Well, I'll probably just buy another one. But consider yourself warned: it doesn't last forever.

 review/text: the vibrating feature on this battery is great, but not as strong as i had expected it to be. i cannot feel it ringing if i have it in a bag or purse, only if it is in my pocket or on my belt. do not put the phone down on a table or a conference desk if you do not want other people to hear it because it can be load. otherwise it is great, and it is neat how it vibrates in time with the tune of your ring. i have not let the battery run down before charging since the first few times i used it and i have had it for 6 months with no troubles.

 review/summary: A neccessary accessory for anyone
 review/text: I've been using nokia 5100/6100 series phones for years, and a vibrating battery is a neccessary accessory. No matter how loud you set the ringer, there will be times where you can't hear the phone ring over a lot of noise (football games, crowded restaurants). Other times you might want to keep the phone on silent, but still be able to tell if someone's calling without disturbing others. I do have to say that if you don't keep the phone in your pocket or on your hip, you won't be able to feel the vibration though. Also, the warning about letting the battery fully discharge before charging is very important. If you don't run down your battery fully by talking frequently, instead letting it discharge on standby, then you have to be extra careful. All of my first few batteries severly underperformed after a few months due to this.

 review/summary: Good but be careful when you charge
 review/text: These extended vibrating batteries are great! They will easily last 3-4 days on one charge. Also the vibrating feature is fun.The only bad thing about the extended battery is it really adds weight and mass to you phone.Another thing i should say is that since this is a Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery you have to be careful when you charge your phone particularly for the first few times. It is recommended that you should only charge this phone when it is completely discharged. DO NOT charge if it is only have way discharged. Otherwise you mess up your battery and battery performance will significantly drop.

 review/text: The vibrating battery is a great idea for people, like me, who do not like to see everybody staring at you when your cell phone rings. I also am very annoyed by other people's cell phone ringing louder than the person next to them. A vibrating battery is a great solution to that.This particular battery could, however, be a little stronger. When I take the bus or on the subway, I can sometimes not feel it vibrate, and therefore miss a call (which is not the end of the world, by the way!!)

 review/summary: A Good Replacement Battery
review/text: I have a Nokia 6162 and after a couple of years the original NiMH battery wasn't holding it's charge well. I held out this long because I was really annoyed that a new battery would cost almost as much as a lot of the cooler new phones around so I was hoping the prices would come down. I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase. At full price, I'd still be annoyed but probably would've bought the battery anyways because I needed one.So far it's working fine. It is EXTREMELY light and somewhat slimmer than my original batter which makes carrying my phone around with me much nicer. The only negative so far is that it doesn't seem to last quite as long between charges (based on my general usage level) as my old battery. However, we're still talking about going days between charges so it's not a complaint just an observation.I'd say if you're looking for a replacement battery that's simple, gets the job done, and will lighten your load a bit, this is a good buy. If the price comes down or you can find a coupon it's an excellent buy.I hope this was helpful and good luck with your purchase!

 review/text: I've gotta say that this is an EXCELLENT product for the price. I've been a musician for 25 years and I know quality sound, and the sound quality of this product is first rate. For those of you getting poor quality sound try CLEANING your tape deck head unit. I know good sound and the clarity is just a tad bit below my CD player. Both units of which are connected in tandem with the same head unit in my F250 Super Duty. I've got 2 kicker 12" subs, a hyphonics 1000 W amp and alpine tweets and like I said the sound is excellent for the price. For those of you that rate this product as poor, you should seriously look at your audio system and maybe spend a few bucks and get a head cleaner, or a new system all together.

 review/summary: Garbage
 review/text: I dont normally review stuff. But i hate this product so much that i just couldn't resist. At least it wasnt expensive, is all i can say. I wish 0 stars was an option. Anyway, the tape keeps spitting out, occasionally it WILL work for a couple songs, while stopping briefly to (im guessing here) flip sides every few moments. Sound quality is a bit fuzzy when it actually plays and sometimes the volume is really low. What a waste.

 review/summary: WOW and 5 STARS for durability
 review/text: I bought this adapter last week from a local retailer. After reading the reviews I was ready to take it back. I did a test run of it today and the sound is pretty good, better than the cheaper one I had before. The WOW and extra stars is for the durability of the charger. It fell out of the car and got run over. With the plastic casing in pieces I plugged it in on a whim and low and behold it still worked. It is now held together by electrical tape and duct tape but I am pretty pleased with everything overall.

 review/summary: Extremely poor sound quality
 review/text: I purchased this cassette adapter in order to listen to music from my ipod in my car. I have to turn the volume on the ipod up all the way, and the volume on the stereo up higher than I usually do, to get any sound. Even then, the sound will suddenly go out for no reason. This is junk. At least the car charger is usable, and the only reason I won't complain about not being able to rate this zero stars.

 review/text: This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED.I would rate my experience with this seller as: DissapointingAt least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.

It worked fine with my Bitpim, but the fact that the playlist function does not work bothered me. Otherwise, it's a fine product that is worth quite a few times its price elsewhere. It's definitely worth the buy, and although it didn't come with all the features it could have had, it's great for its low price.

 review/summary: Excellent product
 review/text: This headset works beautifully, it is lightweight and very comfortable, and the noise reducing microphone is highly effective. My first Logitech headset (the Mobile Freedom, model #F0228A) was larger; the flexible roating clip snapped in half after less than one year of use. Logitech was fabulous and promptly sent me a free replacement headset (the Logitech Mobile Traveller, model #F0399A). This is a smaller, sleeker headset, and even more comfortable than the first one. However, the clip snapped in half after only 4 months of use (mind you, I coddle my phone and headset). This time, Logitech sent me a replacement clip; it's still in one piece 5 months later. I would have rated this 5 stars but for the frail clip.

review/summary: Sigh... if only...
 review/text: I actually bought a precursor to this headset, and after a couple of months the charging capacity failed. I called Logitech and they sent me the Mobile Traveller instead, since the model I had was already obsolete. I really liked this headset! I agree with others that it's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but for an hour drive to or from work, it was good enough, and well worth it for the sound! Even when walking across the parking lot with gusty winds, the person on the other line could barely tell. And the volume actually goes up enough that I could hear them, too. I didn't have any problems with pairing or range, although I didn't really push any of these.But, I'm now where many other reviewers ended up - the earpiece broke. It's not completely gone, and I currently have it taped up so I can still use it until I find an adequate replacement. The Motorola I tried was miserable, and I'm not seeing anything much better.If only Logitech could keep the sound technology but do something about the earpiece comfort and longevity... I would definitely buy that product.

 review/summary: Earloop breaks......... customer service tells you what you want to hear
 review/text: I ordered 4 of the Mobile traveler headsets several months ago. The earloops are very uncomfortabe. 2 months ago my husbands earloop broke. I called LOGITECH customer support. I explained the problem. He told me that the replacement earloop would be shipped out to me within the week. I wanted to PURCHACE more but was told that the only earloop that I was able to get was a replacement for the one that broke. I waited 3 weeks before calling back to find out what was going on. I was then told that I would be recieving a New headset, that she didn't understand why I was told I would get the earloop because they weren't available by themselves. She said that I would recieve it within 7 days. I waited 2 weeks. I called back and was informed that the EARLOOP was on backorder. He then told me that the mobile traveler was no longer being made because of the earloop issue. I was offered a refund, but I had to send the headset in and it would take 3 to 6 months for a refund. The headset itsef is great ( ecept for the earloop) But the customer service is awful.

 review/summary: No compatible with Logitech bluetooth hub??
 review/text: i think that logitech make the best accessories. I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer. The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub. Don't you find that strange? Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model). In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you.

 review/summary: Can you hear me now?
 review/text: I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws. The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good. Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear. My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit. I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times. Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product again

 review/summary: Most uncomfortable headset ever, bad reception
 review/text: Avoid this product at all costs!! I used this headset for only 2 days before giving it the heave-ho. When you first put it on, it does not feel all that uncomfortable...however, after 30 to 45 minutes of use, your ear feels like it is in a vice! Plus, the reception is fine when sitting in a car, however if you stand up it gets crackly and is extremely hard to hear. I repeat: Avoid this product at all costs!!

 review/text: It works very good. Very ggod sound quality and reception. But sometimes it disconnects from the phone,I don't know if that is because of the phone or the bluetooth. The design is not so good. The ear starts paining after an hour or so of wearing the headset.

 review/summary: Unless you have a very quiet place to talk...
 review/text: The problem with Bluetooth headsets in general is they are near your ear but 4-5 inches your mouth. Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception.On the other hand, it is comfortable and works well if you need it where it excels, a quiet room.However, I'll wait until an offering is available that works outside the quiet confines of the design lab.

 review/summary: works great with a razr v3
 review/text: After researching bluetooth headsets on Amazon and asking several people I met in stores, I decided to try this headset. Also 3 salespeople in my company use this headset or the logitech Freedom which is a good value for the price. As for the negative comments about comfort, I also wear glasses. So I took the headset into my local Costco and had the optical dept. heatup and adjust the ear piece. It paired up easly with my Motorola Razar v3. Everyone tells me they hear me clearly and the contol buttoms are easy to use. The volume adjusts just fine for me even with the road noise in my truck. The main thing I wanted in a headset was the ability to voice dial in my truck with road noise and use it outside without a light breeze making it impossible for people to hear me and this headset works great for both compared to a Motorola bluetooth headset I tried before.

 review/summary: Dissapointment
 review/text: I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant.

 review/summary: Good sound, okay transmission, fair battery, poor comfort
review/text: The title sums it up. The sound in th earpiece is pretty good, better than the phone in my case. However, if you have the volume turned all the way up, the other party receives a fair amount of feedback. This can be troublesome during calls with poor connections. The tramission to the phone allows you about 25-30 feet, which is not too shabby. The battery life, however, leaves something to be desired. I generally get about 3 hours talk time total, and find I have to put the unit on the charger more often than I care to. Lastly, the earpiece becomes quite uncomfortable, even when shifting it around. I can only stand it for about an hour and then my ear hurts; it hurts even worse when you take it off as your ear tries to take back its normal shape.It bears mentioning that I received this unit as a replacement/upgrade to the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset, which was defective right from the package.My next headset will probably be a Jabra.

 review/text: This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.

 review/summary: 4.5 Star rating
 review/text: This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this.

 review/summary: Good Clarity and Comfortable
 review/text: I bought the Mobile Traveller SE through Verizon for my Treo 650 within week I noticed that it was dropping the connection with my phone and never knew when I was answering on the phone or headset. I would occassionally press the button to "ping" the phone to verify the connection was there. I called Logitech support and they agreed to send me a new headset. They sent me the non-Verizon version, Mobile Traveller. So far, it is an improvement and I haven't dropped the connection to my phone once this past week. As for the tight fit on the ear, with a little pressure you can bend the ear hook piece to widen it and it will fit looser on the ear. I got mine to fit snugly without the pain and I can wear it all day. I had the Jabra BT350 before (until my 3 year old spilled orange juice on it and ruined it) and for the same price, I'd get the Mobile Traveller with the Windstop microphone, a great improvement over the Jabra.

 review/text: I've had two of these. Both sounded and worked well for a few months. then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second. When this happens, you're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery. While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet) Skip by this one if you're smart. I've been had twice.

 review/summary: Uncomfortable
 review/text: I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller.Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it.Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat?Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

 review/summary: Works good in noisy areas.
 review/text: I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The "windstop" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at "rest". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends.

It holds my Blackberry unbelievably well; allowing it to slide in and out with ease. Highly recommended.

 review/text: This case is extremely well made, and unusual in style. I'm now using it for my Treo 800 (smaller, but there weren't cases available, even from Palm when I first got it). If you have the phone in the case while you're using it, you will often discover that the snap hits the center button on the phone, activating the mute function. By the time you figure it out, the caller has hung up. This happens even if you turn the phone around inside the case and have the mute button facing the back. As long as you're super-conscious, it's okay.

Lots of extras with this phone. I would highly recommend it, especially over the Motorola V3I or the Razr, the 830 is much easier to use, better looking and much slimmer than the Motorola offerings.

 review/summary: Could use more features...
 review/text: The phone arrived right on schedule from the supplier. I've always liked Samsung phones because of their simplicity so I decided to buy the D830. This phone comes with a software CD, data cable, charger cable and headset, which I might add is perfectly equalised and gives off a near "surround-sound system" quality for your music.I received 3 versions of the manaul with the phone in 3 different languages EXCEPT English. Even though the phone is advertised as the 'slimmest' it's still a little on the large side in terms of height and width. The volume of the phone itself (without the earpiece) is low outdoors even when you turn up the volume to the maximum, so if you have trouble hearing, you'll definitely have trouble hearing clearly.When you miss a call, the caller ID on the front of the phone does not alert you. So you can't see right away that you've missed a call unless you open the phone to check.Other than those disadvantages, the phone itself is a good showpiece and overall a trendy design.

 review/summary: Nice phone, but flat keypad is a pain to use
review/text: I just got this phone a few days ago to replace my broken SonyEricsson Z520a. I'm attracted to this Samsung because of the thin form factor and pretty impressive spec.But the first time I used it, I was totally disappointed. My biggest complaint is the flat keypad. The keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. And for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. This really annoys me since I text message a lot.Other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. The screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. IMHO the user interface is not as intuitive as Sony Ericsson's.I tried Bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.But for me, the keypad is the killer. That's the reason I rated it 2 stars. This phone is going back to Amazon for sure.

 review/summary: Great case
 review/text: I know it is silly to be so discerning about a simple cell phone case, but considering how much time I spend using my Samsung A460, the right case was a very important decision. I have friends who have bought Body Glove cases over the Samsung or Sprint products, so without seeing it in person first, I decided to order the Ion from Amazon.com.I have to say that I am very pleased with it. It is sturdy and made of durable material, and the two-piece design makes it easy to place on the phone. It also allows a tighter fit, as opposed to a one-piece case that would have to stretch over the phone. The belt clip is capable yet not intrusive, and the open areas are all appropriate for the phone model. The style is another plus -- nice colors, with the logo on the side. I was pleased to see that "Body Glove" was not stamped on the clear front, unlike the way it looks in the product photo (the lettering is actually on the inside of the case, and is just seen through the clear window since the case is empty in the photo).With these compliments, I do have some criticism. For one, I wish the plastic on the front was simply large enought for the front display. Although the larger window shows the phone's nice silver casing, both all of the plastic on the outside and over the screen on the inside tend to make it stick to the phone. In addition, the seams that stitch the plastic to the neoprene are not clean in some places, and give the rim on the outside of the case a little of a messy look.Overall, though, I would recommed the case to those who want a stylish and protective phone cover but don't want to spend more than [$$] for one.

Doesn't have that whimpy top flap that keeps coming off when you're on a call either...and since the top flap has a longer inside cover, it also acts as a screen protector for the phone's large display screen. Much better than the leather OEM case I had (which broke).

 review/summary: Nearly Perfect Glove
review/text: I went through three leather cases that were sold by my cellular dealer. The leather cases were bulky, poorly constructed and over priced. I was frustrated and turned to Amazon.com to get their reviews on what to get. This Body Glove is by far the best product I have seen available for the V60 phone. The quality of the product is great, construction wonderful. The Body Glove is not bulky, nice to hold in your hand, and offers good protection for the phone. There is one slight flaw in the design, but it is not unique to the Body Glove: If you use a headset, when you open the clam shell the jack for the handest may be pushed out of the socket.

review/summary: Still one of the best out there, but....
 review/text: I prviously owned a Body Glove Ion case for my Nokia 3360 and absolutely loved it. I generally keep my phone in my pocket, so I didn't want a bulky swivel clip case, but I still wanted something to help protect my phone. The Body Glove Ion cases are perfect for this as they provide a tight fitting, rugged case without the bulk of other cases. They also look more stylish and hold up better than the cheap leather most cases use. Needless to say, I was estatic when I discovered there was a Body Glove case for my new Motorola.Unfortunately, I was let down within only a few minutes of receiving my new case. The button that holds the case together split in two with little to no strain placed upon it. Don't get me wrong, it fits well, and after the glue sets I'm sure I will enjoy this case. I'm disappointed in the quality, but until something better comes along, I still think it's the best case of it's kind.

 review/text: The pictures provided on this product's description show two different backs.The case I recieved had the back piece shown in the middle picture, a black swivel clip.This clip is hinged by a very flimsy peice of plastic. It's not even a real hinge. This is not obvious in the picture shown, and in all honesty I was hoping to get the clip shown in the third picture, which looks to be much more solid.It remains to be seen how long this clip will hold up, but I'm rather dissapointed. My last body glove case was terriffic. This one fits great, but the clip leaves alot to be desired.

 review/summary: One of the best I have seen
 review/text: I have tried some leather swivel-clip cases that are floating out there. They weren't bad but they made the phone too bulky. I generally like to put the phone in my pocket and only occasionally wear it on my belt so I needed something that was not too bulky. However, I also wanted to maintain the cool look of the phone.Well, this case appears to be the answer. It is very tight fitting. It is the only case that COMPLETELY covers the display on the inside of the phone and all of the keys on the keypad. They used clear plastic to do this. They punched holes out for the earpiece sections. Everything is very well made and all the cut-outs are formed and placed well to maintain a quality look. The top cover for the phone detaches via a button so you could take it of if desired. I am not sure what type of material it is. I have read it is nylon. It has a pattern on it and is very unique. It has a metal "Body Glove" button on one side.All in all, a very unique, well made case that really doesn't add much bulk to the phone, still maintains a very nice look, and protects the phone well. The only thing to consider is that if you like to wear the phone on your belt most of the time, a swivel clip case may be a better option. Body Glove makes one of those also but of course it is bulkier and therefore wouldn't lend itself to be pocketable.If anyone wonders, I didn't get the case here. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon though and would have bought this if they had it in the color I wanted. I ended up paying more elsewhere just to get it.

 review/summary: Body Glove makes a great product
 review/text: I recently purchased a Motorola V60i phone, and needed a case due to my history of being "heavy handed" with cell phones. Like some of the others who have posted reviews for this product, I too was unhappy with the poor selection of cases available from local vendors for the V60i. All the other cases I found were too bulky (defeating the main reason for choosing this phone in the first place), made from some man-made material that they dare call "leather," and obviously not designed specifically for the V60 series.Here's the bottom line - this case is by far the best one out there, and this comes from a person who spent more time browsing mall kiosks and phone dealers for a case than should be humanly allowed. This case is not bulky, is very durable, and fits the V60 perfectly because it was designed just for this phone.If you want a case for your Motorola V60, this is the one.

 review/summary: Motorola V60i (V60c) Body Glove Ion Case - Outstanding
 review/text: This has to be the best engineered case I have ever owned. More durable and better looking than any leather case. It has a slim belt clip as opposed to that bulky &quot;swivel&quot; clip that will just about double the carrying size of your phone. I usually prefer classic black but the charcoal gray (shade matches the gray antenna) gives the phone a clearly distintive and rich look. The keypad and earpiece sections are fully protected with clear plastic with cutouts where they're supposed to be. A button will detach the earpiece section if you prefer to use your phone that way. The people at Body Glove have this case down to a 5 star science.

 review/text: I have a V60T and this case fits it perfectly.I had shopped around and purchased other cases over the internetand when they arrived I was very unhappy with the quality and fit. I also had purchased the Motorola case from Cingular but the belt clip made the phone to big and bulky. I read the reviewposted and it helped greatly in my decision to purchase this case from Amazon. This is a quality case that I think anyone will be pleased with. If there is anything that Body Glove could add to this case, it would be the hand strap that on other phone cases I have owned I used it as added security around my belt loop.

 review/text: I have been dismayed with two previous cases (not Body Glove cases) for my Motorola V60 mainly because of the poor fit of the cases on the flip open cover. Other cases tended to &quot;ride up&quot; on the cover and make for a terrible problem when trying to listen.Not so with this case.I'm totally satisfied with the fit, and the access it allows to the ports on the top of the phone. Great fit on this case for the exact same price I paid for other cases that didn't fit as well.I would highly recommend this case.

 review/summary: The 'case' has been made.
 review/text: As much as I like the Motorola V60 it seems that Motorola is not intent on producing a nice case for the phone. As usual, Body Glove has stepped up for Motorola as they seem to do for most of the cell phone manufactures. The phone looks great on its own but if you want to protect it, this case is excellent. The fit is very good, with openings and plastic where they should be. This case was made for the V60 and only the V60. If you want to protect your phone without loosing its slim design the price and quality are worth the investment. If you are looking for a protective case for your V60 phone, this is the one to get, it is slim, durable, attractive and a perfect fit.

 review/summary: Better than OEM
review/text: OEM accessories are supposed to be superior than aftermarket copies, in style and function. However, Motorola missed the boat here. I bought their 'leather' case, and was very disappointed. I read the reviews for the Body Glove Ion and went out and bought one. I have not been disappointed. There is no comparision between the Ion and the OEM case. The Ion is far superior in construction, style, and function. All the necessary holes are punched out exactly where they should be. The stitching appears to be more precise, and the overall fit for my V60i is much better. The dimensions of this case 'hug' the phone much better, thus it shows off the phone's clean lines. The low-profile design equals less bulk. Motorola engineers need to go on a field trip to the Body Glove offices to see how the competition is running circles around them in the accessories market.

 review/summary: The Best
 review/text: I had an Ion cover for a Nokia phone I had and was very pleased with it. When I bought the V60, I got another Ion cover for it. I like that it is slim and doesn't cause the phone to stick far out from my waist line like the clip that came with the phone. I also like how it protects the phone. I work in a harsh manufacturing environment where water, chemicals, and abrasions wreak havoc on my cell phones. This is by far the best protection I've found for any of my phones.

 review/summary: Snug, well-made & functional, but a bit bulky
 review/text: I bought this case based on reviews of a bunch of cases for the V60 series phones. It does fit snugly, but at least in my case it is such a tight fit that the bottom half of the case never wants to stay all the way on, and tends to slide down juuuust a tad, like a couple millimeters or so. That's just a picky aesthetic thing, though, and doesn't affect the functionality. The case is definitely well constructed -- it's not going to fall apart, even at stress points. It has openings in all the right places, and the clip is very sturdy and low-profile. I do miss the shiny case of the bare phone, but obviously that's a sacrifice one has to make in order to protect the phone. A nice side effect of the case is that it makes it much easier to open the phone with one hand to take a call, because it's easier to slip your thumb between the two parts of the case than between the two halves of the phone itself. However, the case does increase the thickness of the phone from just about an inch, to a good inch and a half. I'm not wild about that, but all cases increase the bulk, and after looking at a lot of cases, I still think this is the best-made and best-fitting, and even though it's expensive, I would buy it again.

 review/summary: Big Ears Only?
 review/text: I bought this one for me because it matches my phone color.Pros: It is easy to connect to the phone. I have a Motorola Razr. The reception is great. The calls are very clear. My calls are static-free under most circumstances. It has worked better in that situation than my previous headset.Cons: It is a little large. It is not truly hands-free. It fits so loosely that I have to hold it on my ear to hear a call clearly and to keep it from falling off. The earhook is made of hard plastic that won't bend. That makes it so it doesn't need to be replaced as often as one that does but it also makes it so that you can't adjust it to your ear size. I need to charge it every other night.I have used 2 different wireless headsets. They both seem to drain a lot of power from the phone and require that they both be charged more frequently than if you didn't use it.

I was looking for a nice snug fit that wouldn't fall off at just a shake of my head, and this ain't it! Don't really like the volume control either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it came in a package that included a matching case with a wrist strap (designed for a Razor but fits my LG Muziq just fine) and a little screen cleaner that works nicely, so not a TOTAL loss I guess, but still irritating and disappointing. I got a Plantronics that fits and sounds great, so my pretty pink matching H500 will reside in the back of the kitchen junk drawer. Live and learn ;)

Unless the phone is sitting at the right angle, contact is not made properly, and no charging occurs. this is annoying since the phone tends to bounce around a little in my truck, and I have to insert the phone upside down into my cup holder to maintain just the right angle with the charging cord.All in all, I wish I'd spent more money on a better quality charger. The build quality of this unit seems good, but the performance is poor.

Treo end of the cable was extremely tight initially, so tight I was actually concerned about pushing it in as hard as I did. However, it loosened up after two or three times.The cord generates a tremendous amout of RF interference, to the point that AM radio stations cannot be heard depending on the station's strength. However, I'm listening to the radio less and less so its most likely not an issue. Interference was not detected on Ham 2M radio or commercial FM, just commercial AM.

 review/summary: DANGER!!! Avoid This Company !!!!
 review/text: I had a NON extended Samsung battery for nearly three years and needed to replace it. Well I purchased the EXTENDED version of this battery fully believing it would work great. Well I was VERY surprised to find out that it actually gave me LESS talk time then my 3 year old NON EXTENDED battery. It could not even hold a charge for one day.When I contacted the company for a refund they REFUSED to accept the return because I did not keep the original packaging which is crazy because it is a battery and who would expect a battery not to work?But WAIT, it gets WORSE!!When I posted a negative feedback, they contacted me and asked me to remove it and they would give me a refund. I removed it and they NEVER gave me the refund.So NOT only does this company produce DEFECTIVE products they lie and don't honor their word.They deserved to be removed from Amazon. I have contacted their security department and they are conducting a full investigation. In the meantime. DO NOT purchase ANYTHING from this vendor.They are EVIL and will likely soon be banned from Amazon.

review/text: great product but is does have a glich. When charging the battery, and you restart the cp, it give me a message, "use original battery" and will start a 10 second count down and shut the cp off. This will happen at least 3 time. To restart the cp I need to plug the charger back and restart the cp at least twice.

 review/text: If you are looking for a replacement battery for your LG phone, this is the one to get. I needed one for my phone and Verizon wanted $39.95 for it. This one was a lot cheaper and seems to last forever. My old battery ( even new ) would only last a day. This battery last 2 - 3 days before I charge it. ( even then it has 2 bars left ) And the replacement cover fits well and will fit in your phone case perfectly. Awesome product !!

 review/summary: BEST BATTERY EVER
 review/text: My original battery for the LG VX 8100 was never great, but after the 6 month period it would die after 2 phone calls which totaled 2 phone calls.This extended battery is awesome. I made a ton of calls, sent texts and pics, and it stays at fully charged for over 2 days. The price is MUCH cheaper than my service carrier's, who wanted to charge me $42 for the same thing. It needs an overnight charge about once a week! Love it!

 review/text: The battery is great, I've charged it once in a week (with plenty of web/talk time on it). It's still holding at 2 bars. The cover doesn't quite snap back into place and has a tendency of falling off at random...Still, not bad for the price, and certainly cheaper than an original LG/Verizon battery

 review/summary: Long time user, no problems
 review/text: I'm not sure what these last few negative reports are about! It's weird that they all come one right after the other. If I was a suspicious type...but I'm not. Maybe there was a bad manufacturing run, or some people just had real bad luck, but my experience has been excellent. As long as I'm on the subject of negative reviews - I've got tons of third party software loaded and this treo is more stable than the Windows XP desktop that I'm typing this review on. It does crash, but, very, very infrequently.In fact, this has been the best piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I've had it since the month it was released, and I'm still using it all day, every day, even up to now.I've used it with two different carriers - first Cingular and then T-Mobile. It has had excellent reception, (better than my wife's Nokia), from both carriers.And it is pretty rugged. I've dropped it: 5 or 6 times - on concrete at least twice. It's chipped up, but still works the same as the day I bought it.I bought a 1 gig SD Card, and I carry around a lot of music. So much that I never use my iPod anymore. I also joined [...]and I have room for one or two spoken-word books too.On the large internal memory I have eBooks, games, business applications, docs, spreadsheets, a video player, more games, and did I mention games?The phone and PIM functions are smoothly integrated and email is a breeze.My company gave me a RIM BlackBerry 7510 phone + email device. It is absolutly primitive compared to the Treo 600.The Treo's screen is super bright, easily visible even in bright sunlight. I love the fact that I have a keybord on the phone even if I don't use it all the time. I installed a thirdparty application that lets me write Graffiti style right on the touch sensitive display.The fact that it is a Palm device means it is as configurable as you want it to be. There are tens of thousands of software applications and upgrades available.So, in summary, in one pocket I carry a great phone, a fine chess partner, a calendar, my contact lists, a memo/note pad, an ebook-reader and half a dozen ebooks, an Audible player and a couple of audio books, an MP3 player and a bunch of songs, a fantasy role playing game, a backgammon game, poker and a solitaire card games, an MS Word doc reader, the "Bejeweled" game, a midi music sequencer, an email application, a world alarm clock/timer, a space conquest game, an investment calculator, and 10 or so more things (mostly games).I LOVE this phone. And it is unlocked, so I was able to change carriers with no hassel - if you've done this recently you will appreciate that this is no small thing.So, you may be wondering, "is this guy just going to gush? Isn't there anything you don't like about the phone?"Well yes, in fact, the camera sucks. It is better than nothing and I have had occasion to use it a few times, but it is low resolution, somewhat distorting and useless in anything but well lit situations.I'd still say it was the best, most useful piece of electronics I'd ever owned, even if there were no camera.

 review/summary: Do Not Buy a TREO
 review/text: I had such faith in this phone when I first bought it. Now that I am 7 treo phones later and it only being a year and a half....I have to say that this is the worst high end purchase I have ever gotten. In the beginning all of the reviews were wonderful from consumer reports and gadget blogs and electronic magazine reviews. However none of these publications seems to have let consumers know the truth about the horrible quality of these phones. As a pda they function fairly well but as a phone...the signal is always dropping (that is if there is a signal). Friends and family claim it is hard to hear what I was saying when using the phone and that it sounded like I was in a tunnel. Hearing what other people were saying was difficult. i would have to go outside to try to get a better signal just to hear what was being said. I purchased my phone through Amazon to use with Sprint. I invested in the monthly warranty to replace the phone. This seemed like a good plan until I realized that they were replacing my phone with refurbished phones that had the same problems as the handset that I had just given them. When my final sixth phone was replaced by Sprint I made a call to a friend from the parking lot to ensure that it worked before I left the store (I had learned by this point). Five minutes later yelling into the phone and trying to call back 3 times with no success (and no...the mute was not on). Realizing that I had yet another dud on my hands I went back into the Sprint store to take out the poor 16 year old clerk that had the misfortune of replacing my handset five minutes prior. Apparently he had a panicked look on his face since he was waiting on customers who had just decided to get...you got it, a Treo 600. Well he quickly summoned his manager who decided to give me a brand-new never been opened treo 650 free. So yes I did get an upgrade free for all of my trouble. It is not much better than the treo 600. The signal is weak and it is hard to hear on both ends and when on vibrate mode the calls get sent straight to voicemail. Convenient for emergencies I would say. I live in Arizona but I sure do wish that I lived in California since there is currently a class-action suit against palm-one and the various cell phone carriers of the treo 600 and 650 for the poor quality of the product and replacing handsets with equally poor treos. At this point since the treo 700 just was released, it probably is not on the class action suit. However the treo 700 does run on a windows operating system which will make your palm os software from your treo 600/650 obsolete. It will also make it morevulnerable to viruses and lets not forget that little trick of being able to erase a bluetooth devices address book when someone has bluetooth enabled, Also there is the ability to tap into peoples' conversations that they are having with their wireless blue-tooth headset. (not that I do it but I'm sure that some people are actually enjoying rush hour much more due to this security flaw). Overall I would say that palm-one as a company has gone downhill in terms of quailty and customer service and that both the treo 600 and 650 are phones that I would not waste your time or money on.

 review/summary: Treo is Total Junk !
 review/text: I've been a Palm fanatic for over 10 years. I've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out. I agree with many of these reviewers that the Treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc. But it is completely unreliable. I'm currently on my 3rd 600. Each one died a hideous death after about 6 months. First the normal phone speaker died. So Handspring replaced it for free. Six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when I was traveling.) So again handspring replaced it. About 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned. This time when I called for a new one I was informed by Palm that, "We don't replace phones for free any more. It will cost you $200 to get a replacement." So basically Palm's business model is: we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry. It's unbelieveable. So I thought I'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability). But Palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 ! I said, "Wait a minute, Handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if I'd send my old one back." But I was informed that Palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore. What a joke.So I wrote a letter to the CEO of Palm to complain. That was 5 months ago. No response or acknowledgement. What a disappointing company - in every aspect of it.I now use a Motorola Razor. Palm is a joke. No serious business person can rely on the Palm products or the company any more. Shame.

 review/summary: Terrific until the warranty runs out
 review/text: Great concept, I've had a palm pda since the first palm pilot personal then professional then a 7 and then the i version for internet with palm.net. I love the palm apps calendar and contacts, but this phone that cost $500 started to give me problems right after the year warranty time period. (which just so happened to coinside with the Katrina catastrophe when our phones weren't working anyway due to service problems). The problem still continues with the same as the other reviewer mentions with this loud buzzing on the receiver side of the phone call. It's terrible and not usable this way. I'm afraid to send it for repair based on what another reviewer said that he got a refurbised model that was in worse shape than his and then after a few months had serious problems. The repaired phones are only warranted for 90 days, not long enough for these problems to show up. Palm should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better support for such expensive phones!!! I bought mine unlocked directly from Palm as well.

 review/summary: Buyer Beware!
 review/text: I bought the unlocked TREO 600 one year ago for $549. It has been replaced 3 times. I gave up and bought the unlocked 650. It crashed in 2 weeks. I returned it. I am now stuck with a 600 that is now out of warranty. Service: forget about it. All you will get is put on hold from India and they charge $25 per call after a few months. The 600 reboots itself, turns itself off, loses all email settings, causes duplicates in OUTLOOK. 13 birthday reminders is 12 too many. It corrupted my address book and changed people's names and phone numbers, even after I did a hard reset and uninstalled and reinstalled the software. You will never get to talk to a US Palm tech, only India. I bought this from the Palm store. The phone has known issues with older SIM cards. I am now getting the Blackberry.

 review/summary: great world phone/pda!
 review/text: This phone works everywhere in the world, (anywhere there is GSM service) Being unlocked, you can use local Simm cards in each country, or purchase an international simm card. The Simm card slot is very easily accessible, too (no need to pull out batteries, ect.) The Palm pilot is great, and very useful for travelers with many currency conversion, language softwares available for it. Texting from a Treo is way easier than typical mobile phones, because you have a full keyboard. International SMS (text) messages are typically very affordable, too, and a great way to keep in touch while abroad without spending alot on airtime..i highly recommend this treo for overseas travellers. If you're staying in the states, this phone will work well with Cingular or T mobile too.Price is reasonable because the the treo 650 and 700 are now out. the 650 adds bluetooth, and a removable battery. the 700 uses microsoft software instead of palm software. (i am a huge fan of the palm software for organizing my life..)But unlocked versions of these newer models are at least $200-300 more in price, and the 600 works great. Battery life is fine because its a GSM phone.

 review/summary: Terrific Phone/PDA
review/text: Everyone in my family now owns a Treo, and each one of us has only good things to say about it. The phone gets excellent reception; whereas I've heard many people in my town complain about getting poor service on their cell phones, I have never been unable to place a call on my Treo or been cut off during the middle of a conversation.Those unfamiliar with the Palm OS will find it wonderfully easy to navigate and to configure. Furthermore, there is a vast and diverse array of progams one can download for the Palm OS, ranging from games, e-texts and MP3 player software to business applications, medical references and legal dictionaries.I originally had some qualms about the fact that the Treo had a keyboard instead of the graffiti system to which I was accustomed, but I've come to prefer the keyboard. I can write with the Treo keyboard much more quickly and conveniently than I could write with the graffiti system on other Palm Pilots. That being said, those who prefer graffiti to the keyboard can always download programs that enable one to write with graffiti directly onto the screen. Also, I've found the Palm Portable Keyboard (sold separately) to be very helpful and easy to use when I need to write more than a few lines, and I would recommend purchasing that item as well.My heart goes out to other reviewers who have found their Treos to be fragile, but I cannot claim to have had the same experience. My Treo has gone everywhere with me during the past year and has hardily withstood much wear and tear during that time. I've dropped it a few times without any consequences. Furthermore the screen is as bright and easy to see now as it was when I first got it.The camera part of the phone is admittedly lacking in quality. On the rare occasion when I need to use my Treo to take a picture of something, I make sure to take several different pictures on the theory that at least one will turn out as a passable representation of what I was trying to photograph. But the Treo's advantages as a phone, a Web browser, a word processor and a PDA far outweigh any inadequacies the camera presents.In summary, my Treo is easily one of the best electronic items I've ever owned, and I would highly reccomend it over any other phone and any other PDA.

review/summary: Wait for something better
 review/text: I sync my Treo with my apple computer and have no problems (you'll need the "missing sync" software). The Treo itself has some issues that have disappointed me, however:Like all PDA Operating Systems (OS's), including Windows, they tend to crash a lot. What I've discovered is that this OS is extremely stable but only when I load the right programs. It's like driving a car, but only down certain streets, or you'll fall off a cliff. It's hit-or-miss adventure; you'll have to load programs one at a time and after a few days, see if they created any problems or crashes. If not, then you should have no issues with crashes; then go ahead and load the next one. If you experience problems, you can delete it and it will resolve the crash issue. But not being able to use a program (especially a much needed one) is very disappointing and a downfall for some users like me. This hugely limiting factor seems to make my Treo resemble more of an expensive organizer. Some folks simply live through the PDA crashes but I can't adjust to it. You need to count on some good luck and hope a program will not cause problems. The good news is that the few times it has crashed, I never once lost my data and could go on using my PDA as before. This is important if you're not near your computer for a sync. You simply unscrew the tip of the stylus to reveal a pin that you can use to hit the tiny "reset" button. The Treo re-boots with all my data, contacts & calendar intact.Bluetooth: The lack of bluetooth is also a bummer. I did not think I would need bluetooth, but now realize its usefullness. As technology improves, this Treo is at a disadvantage.Phone contacts: You can easily pop in your sim card but you can't save or utilize the phone book on your sim card. You'll have to either import your contacts from your computer or type it into the phone manually. This is not a good feature if you pop your sim card between different phones.Internet: Good colors & graphics, but connection is slow. A real pain to type quickly with the thumb keyboard.Portability: This Treo is quite bulky and heavy. It's not one that you can simply throw in your pocket and go hang out in the park with. It gets in the way and fits better in your handbag or briefcase. But then you might not hear the phone or feel it vibrate, which is defeating.Photos: The quality of the pictures are not very good. You can easily set the phone to display a picture of your caller, but that's not a remarkable feature.Graffiti: You can't write graffiti style on the screen. You have to use the thumb keyboard or type it in with the sylus.To Do List: If you accidently tap the box next to a To-Do-List item, it will delete your note and sometimes you can't undo the action, so be careful.For most of these issues, there are folks selling third party solutions. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.There are some pluses: the Treo is a quad-band phone. I use T-Mobile in NYC and get great reception. I also travel all over the world to places like India, Egypt, & West Africa and call home with perfect reception. It has a never ending "call-log" that has helped me in many ways. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.Personally, I think this Phone/PDA is too expensive, too heavy and needs some upgrading. The PDA/phone market is slowly improving but it needs a lot of work. If you must buy this Treo, keep a small cellphone nearby so you can pop in your sim card and throw the cellphone in your pocket when you want to travel light. Otherwise, you'll be tied down to the Treo's bulkiness when you don't need it.

 review/text: A few friends bought the 600 when it first came out--nightmare quality problems. But it looks like Palm's worked the bugs out, and prices are coming down because of the 650. I have Cingular service and it works great just about anywhere; if you travel around the country Cingular or Verizon are safe (but relatively expensive) bets. The only difficulty I have with the 600 is the keypad--the keys are small packed tightly together. Otherwise, screen navigation is easy, battery life good, phone sound quality better than any standard cell phone I've used.

 review/summary: Good PDA, Terrible phone
 review/text: The PDA features work well. Syncs up easily with computer. However, phone reception is terrible. Admittedly, I live in a fringe area but the old Sanyo 8100 worked just fine on the Sprint network. Even bought external antenna to improve reception and stop dropped calls but did no better. Ready to sell and start over.

I ordered one on Sunday Aug. 21 and was told it would ship on the 23rd or 24th (it's advertised as "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days.) By the end of business on the 24th I called and was told they didn't have the phone and the new estimated ship date was now Aug. 29. On the 29th, I called in the morning and was told they had the phone and it was scheduled to ship out. In the afternoon I called again and was told it showed to be on backorder and they had no idea when it would ship. That's when I cancelled the order. Watch out, for it still says "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days."

 review/summary: Terrific concept poor execution.
 review/text: I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited. The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ), internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning.So why only two stars?? and why poor execution? Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!! Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil. It worked, but it should never had to be necessary.Also screens are week. Drop on the hard service will break it. Luckily for

 review/text: I have had this phone for over a year and was pleased with every aspect of it, other than its size. For anyone shopping for a PDA and wants it to have phone and internet capability you realy can not go wrong with this one, especialy since the price has gone down dramaticaly after the introduction of the Treo 650 which if you have the money has some nice upgrades that would have made my life easier.

 review/summary: A True Convergence Device!
 review/text: I've owned my Treo 600, bought via Amazon, for about 4 months now and I am really enjoying it. I had previously owned an old Palm V, and then an HP Jornada, but found, lacking a utility belt, carrying a PDA in addition to a cell phone annoying to the point that I eventually abandoned PDA use. The Treo has brought me back.As a writer, I've been able to work on manuscripts (via QuickOffice) any time, any place (indeed, I probably did 25% of the editing for my latest novel on my Treo) which in invaluable. The phone functions clearly, and the camera lets me take photos (albeit low-res) on the go, which is handy to capture family moments and work diagrams equally well.With the free CoreMedia player, DVD/AVI conversion software, and a 1G card, I've even been able to take my favorite movies with me on the go, and watch martial arts instructionals any time.Only downsides are the lack of higher screen resolution and the inability to preserve data when fully discharged. I understand these are both fixed on the Treo 650, so perhaps I'll look into upgrading in a year or two.Definately my favorite gadget to date!

The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented. Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$.

 review/text: I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now????

 review/summary: I'm waiting for my 4th Treo...
 review/text: Think twice before you buy this. My first and second Treo 600s had identical problems, where they couldn't find the network for some reason, and the answer button wouldn't work. I got the first one in February 05, and the 1st replacement in April 05. The second replacement came a week later. Now, this one has developed these orange pixels [http://discuss.treocentral.com/archive/index.php/t-51494.html], and Sprint is going to replace this one. I will note that Sprint has only replaced my phone with refurbished phones, so I can just imagine that I'm just waiting on my replacement phone, which is just Joe Schmoe's broken phone that has the same darn problems. I just hope that all of these problems keep happening within the warranty period. If you can, buy the warranty.

 review/summary: Great phone - just don't get it with Verizon Wireless
 review/text: Well, as an early adapter, I guess I should be used to taking it hard. I bought Verizon's PalmOne Treo 600 the first day it came out - over a year after AT&T;, Sprint, and other comapnies released it. My plan is 400 anytime minutes, unlimited in-network calling, unlimited nights and weekend, and $5 for Internet access a month. Unless I go over, it should cost me $49.95 a month. I just got my first bill.$1,641.66.It turns out that the connection to the Internet doesn't shut off - even if you chose "Disconnect" from the web browser's menu. Even if you turn off the unit. It continues to ping the Internet looking for data every six minutes. Hence my bill show some 1023-minute calls.Steve in Verizon's data division said they've received a lot of calls on this issue and isn't sure why they even offer the $5 web-only feature, when customers need to get the $49.95/month unlimited data transfer or deal with $1,000-plus monthly bills. When I asked if there was a way to stop the pinging every six minutes, I was told no, "it's a data phone first and a cell phone second."Interesting, as my friends who have the phone with other carriers have never had this problem. Interesting, as I was never told this when I bought it. All I wanted was a freakin' cell/PDA combo, so I don't have to carry both with me, making me look like I'm sporting a chubby in two pockets at once. With Verizon, the cost for doing so is $44.95 plus your calling plan a month, which for me will come to about $100.After 58 minutes, I was told my bill should be adjusted within 24 to 48 hours.Also, on Verizon Wireless's PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone web page it lists a 5 MB transfer for only $24.95. When I asked the technical rep about that option, he said getting it would still cause a Treo 600 owner's bill to be over $1,000 a month. He said it was up there for use with other phones. He had no answer when I said there are no other phones on that page.Now, I probably could return the Treo 600 - except I already sold my old phone and Palm on eBay.Of course, if I could just get a free minute for every time I heard "Oh, that's the new phone. I'm not familiar with it" none of this would be an issue.Buy the phone from AT&T;, Sprint, Cingular, or another carrier and don't deal with the problems I had with Verizon Wireless. The phone is great!

 review/summary: Great Value!
 review/text: Okay, this phone isn't perfect but it gets 5 stars. Why? Because at this moment its the best value for your money. Sure, the 650 is better, but unless you want to lock yourself into a 2 year contract its going to cost significantly more. Other comparable options cost similar to the 650.What I use it for: I'm a T-mobile customer and this phone is a) cheaper than the phone through T-mobile and b) is unlocked. So when I'm in Europe this spring I can simply replace the SIM and go. Note that this is the GSM model - it won't work on Verizon or Sprint.Pros: Syncing is effortless, scheduling software mimics Outlook 2003 perfectly. Phone works great - good reception and sound quality.Cons: No bluetooth, no WIFI (the 650 lacks this as well). Screen isn't hi res, camera quality is low (if you want quality get a digicam, I have a Canon S400). Lets be honest - this is yesterday's technology.Unknowns: Reliability. I've only had this phone for a few days, and we'll see how it stands the test of time.Conclusion: If you want the latest and greatest get the 650, Nokia 9300, or something else. But you'll be paying that early adopter premium. If you want something that elegantly does the job at a great price then get this.

 review/summary: Awesome phone/pda! (for about 6 months)
 review/text: As far as design and user-friendliness, I can't say enough about how great this phone/pda combo is. I just wish it wasn't such a POS!I bought an unlocked Treo 600 directly from PalmOne.com about 1 year ago, as I travel internationally and didn't want the hassle of being limited to just one carrier's simcard. It worked wonderfully for a few months, synched effortlessly with Outlook, and was a breeze to enter data into with the qwerty keyboard. I loved trading in my Palm and old cell phone for one combined piece of equipment. The only problem I had right from the beginning is that my earlobe (which must be a genetic abnormality, as I haven't seen any other mention of this problem) would line up just right with the "hang up" button on the touchscreen and would disconnect my calls. I would finally realize it when my phone would ring loudly in my ear as the other person was already calling me back while I was still talking. I can excuse this issue, however, and blame myself for apparently holding the phone at the wrong angle. No problem.And yet... about 6 months into my ownership of the Treo 600, an extremely loud buzzing sound emerged on the other end of the line. I couldn't hear it myself, but everyone I talked to asked if I was being electrocuted, or being run over by a train, or if I was standing on the runway instead of in the airport. I called Palm and was obviously connected to Thailand or India or wherever the call center (which certainly wasn't a problem, just an observation) and they said this was a common problem and they'd be happy to send me a new one. Great! I got my "new" Treo very quickly with no charge for shipping, but was somewhat displeased to find out it was a refurbished phone and my old one I sent back was in better condition (as far as scratches on the body, screen clarity, etc.). Anyway, I was so happy to get rid of the problematic one that I went along with it. Now I wish I hadn't!About a month ago (just past the warranty expiration on the original unit, not sure it would even transfer to my refurbished one) the Treo's screen calibration kept becoming inaccurate. I'd reset the calibration and not 10 minutes later it'd be off again. It would get maybe 1 inch off calibration, so I'd intend to choose one calendar entry, and it would instead hit the button for Monday and skip to another day! Or I'd attempt to pick 5pm and it would highlight the entry at 10am. There was apparently no fix for this issue, even with hard resets, reinstallations of software, etc.I was pretty upset that within just over 1 year I was already trying to replace my second Treo. Anyway, to make a long story short, I pawned it in Asia to a used cell phone vendor that was so desperate to get an American phone he didn't seem to care that the screen was misaligned, and now I'm here on Amazon purchasing a Blackberry...

Everything I have used it for works well and is reliable. Good signal strength, clear calls (with Verizon NYC) My PDA software works seamlessly (epocrates, pediasuite, worldmate etc. I don't have much negative to say about this device. It is everything I expected; a functional reliable pda and cell phone. Good expandability with S/D-I/O slot.However, some negatives...it is pricey, no bluetooth or wi-fi, no voicedial, screen is not highest of resolutions...but then again, I rather have the good battery life and smaller package.All in all exceleent useful device.

 review/summary: A good smartphone plagued with a few serious problems
 review/text: I recently bought an unlocked version of this phone off eBay to replace a Moto Razr phone and an older Palm PDA. It was a pain lugging both of them around and I wanted a device that had both a PDA and phone in one plus e-mail and web browsing capabilities like a Blackberry. A tall order but this phone nearly pulls it off.Palm users will have no trouble using the familiar PalmOS apps that we've all come to know and love such as Calendar, To-Do List, and Memo Pad. The 4-way navigation button makes it faster and easier to navigate than using the touchscreen although I do find myself whipping out the stylus every now and then. There is no graffiti input on this PDA instead you must use either the qwerty keyboard or touchscreen which have their own inherent difficulties. The tiny keyboard buttons are hard to press and often results in typos. Its slower than using the touchscreen keyboard and definately not ideal for writing long e-mails and such. The touchscreen on this phone is not as forgiving as the one on my old Handspring Visor. You have to be extremely gentle when weilding the stylus because even a small amount of pressure can cause yellow spots to form on the LCD screen. I use the touchscreen occassionally with great care and with a protective cover on the screen and yet I still got a faint yellow spot on the LCD within days. For me this is the most dissappointing thing about this phone.As a phone the Treo 600's performance is mediocre to average at best. It gets horrible reception indoors. People often complain about static when I'm inside buildings. Poor reception is also accompanied by a loud, annoying buzzing noise that both people on the line can hear. I looked it up on the web and discovered through user reviews that this was an all-too-common problem amongst many Treo 600 users. When it does get good reception, however, the call quality is superb even better than my Moto Razr. The speakerphone is nice and loud although it can be hissy sometimes.But my favorite feature by far is the ability to send and receive e-mail. Using the Snappermail app (the built-in mail app isn't very good), I can seamlessly link up to my Gmail account and use push e-mail just like on a Blackberry. Plus, its a lot cheaper to use T-zones for e-mail and Internet access on a Treo than the Internet/E-mail plans offered by T-mobile for Blackberrys.All in all, this is a phone I can live with for the time being although I am ever so-concerned about the LCD screen going bad with use. The fragile screen, hard to use keypad, and subpar phone are the only real drawbacks of this phone but they are serious enough that anyone thinking of getting this phone should give it a good, hard second look. I've heard the Treo 650 has fixed some of these problems and if that's true I would definately consider it over the 600. I do plan to upgrade to another smartphone in a few months when my contract expires such as T-Mobile MDA or Treo 650.

 review/summary: so you think this phone is no good??
 review/text: I have just received my treo 600 from Amazon. Brilliant service and bang on time.I read the previous reviews and was concerned about buying this phone.However,I do believe that there were some bad phones around initially.... ( the treo 600 came out in 2002/3 if my memory serves me correctly). The phone you buy today is bug free ( well mine is??). This phone is the best I have ever purchased- and is pretty easy to use. I had a treo 270 some time ago - but dropped it and it was not worth repairing.There is no comparison between the two- and I think the palm Os is better. The battery life is as stated, and it easily pulls in my GSM signal at the extremities of the cell range. So why all the bad reviews? Frankly, I dont know why.You dont need the 650 .But I must admit, that I never seem to get the lemons???

 review/summary: Just what I was looking for...
 review/text: This phone is just what I was looking for: a way to combine my PDA with a good cell phone. It has all of the functionality of my palm device, plus the wireless phone and internet access. I really got tired of managing over 200 contacts on a cell phone - entering information using a phone dialing pad. Now I can enter contacts from my Outlook Contacts folder and hot-sync my phone with my laptop. Buying the phone unlocked enabled me to just pop in my existing SIM and use the phone with my provider (Cingular).Here are the reasons I didn't give this phone 5 Stars (you can judge how important they are to you):1) Lack of bluetooth2) Camera is ok at best - don't use it for graduation photos :-)3) Low screen resolution (still good and usable, but res could be better)4) Not graffiti enabled (although I purchased third party software [Jot] that works great).If items 1, 2, and 3 are a problem to you, then you might want to try the Treo 650, which costs a little more, but addresses those shortcomings. I am happy with the 600. It has been worth the money so far. ONE WARNING: If you purchase the unlocked phone, be careful downloading firmware updates from the PalmOne website. After performing an update, my phone locked and I couldn't use the phone with my Cingular SIM. Fortunately, I was able to get help from the seller and my phone is back to full functionality.

 review/summary: Great pda, decent phone, so-so mp3-player
review/text: I was in the market for a phone, and I gave this a try, because I liked the fact that I could carry this around instead of a phone, an MP3-player, and a PDA. Although I list more cons than pros here, I really do like the phone a lot, and I would recommend it (4 stars). The cons are minor things that I think would be a nice addition, and some people might find it helpful.Pros:- Combines a phone, MP3 player, and PDA in a nice package that fits in my hand. All three have functioned very well for me.- QWERTY keyboard (though it is a bit small)- PalmOS (standard PDA OS; easy to synchronize with your computer)Cons:- No bluetooth (not a big deal for me)- No WiFi- Audio quality (phone is so-so, MP3 is decent)- Low-resolution screen (650 is high-res)- Requires special adapter for listening to MP3s (you can't simply get a 2.5mm-to-stereo adapter from RadioShack. Otherwise the phone uses its speakers to play the music)- The camera is pretty much useless at VGA-quality, and don't even bother taking indoor pictures.I would also recommend getting the following accessories:- ZipLinq retractable USB sync cable (~$30; also charges the phone)- Seidio earbuds/headphones (~$30; made for Treos, you can listen to music with this one)- SD memory card (for MP3's)- a case (under $30 - if you don't want to keep it in your pocket)- PDANet software ($30 - allows you to use the phone as a wireless modem if you have Internet access in your phone plan)One last thing is, you can get a pretty decent GPS unit for another $150.

review/summary: Palm not supporting it's product
 review/text: This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a "premium exchange option" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not.

 review/summary: Piece of Junk
 review/text: I have always liked palm products. We use them in our business and they do save us a lot of time. I purchased this product to save myself from having to carry a palm and a phone.The good:Very loud ringer.Plays MP3's with a mini sd card and free player ava on download.com.Nice looking and feels well made when holding it in your hand.Uses Palm software for 100's of software titles.Keyboard is easy to use.The Bad:No properly functioning alarm clock. One can be purchased for $20!!!Has a huge delay when answering a phone call for the caller to hear your "Hello"Case is "slick" and is easy to fall out of your hand when talking.Charging system is junk. Broke 1st day It arrived.If phone falls just right it is broke beyond repair.I truly loved this phone but it just is not a real business phone. It does what it is supposed to do, but can not stand up to the slighest drop or "real world" hazards. I have an el-cheapo phone that has been through a war and still works and cost $49. For the original price of this I would expect the same. I would recommend buying another phone, as the quality is really bad.

 review/summary: Palm is not interested in supporting - provided misleading info
 review/text: Hi,Before buying this phone from Amazon, I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. It starts with a HAGA which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the AT&T; Wireless Network. According to them, I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the T-Mobile network. How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone, obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network.Palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon. Amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.Thanks

 review/summary: Had it for a Year
 review/text: I have heard a lot of bad comments about this product. I think the problem is that there have been different versions of the Treo 600. But the one I had was perfect, had it for a year and never gave me a problem, even dropped it a few times. I recently got my Treo 650 and gave the 600 to a friend; this one is so much better. I'm happy :).

I am just hoping that I am within the warrantee -- something that Cingular cannot confirm, although I have had the various phones almost a year -- or just over a year. You are asking for it if you buy this device!

 review/text: I bought this phone 2 months back. This looks good and it has more functionality of PDA and also works as a good mobile phone. The concern here is some time when you make a call it is not getting disconnected and we need to switch off the mobile mode.The speaker phone quality is good and talk time is also good.I recommend you can buy this but see for better option also.

 review/summary: Problem Phone
 review/text: The treo 600 has been nothing but problems for me. First after I bought the phone it took verizon a while to figure out how to turn it on...the store said they couldn't do it. Then the phone stopped working and would reset itself when I tried to use anything at all. After getting a new phone I got a 1000 dollar bill from verizon because they had signed me up for the wrong plan and the internet would stay on for 24 hours straight. After a few months the new phone is no longer working...it is now constantly reseting itself. I'm very frustated. Great idea combining phone and pda but get a different model and don't use verizon. By the way the camera is crap...0.3 megapixel...doesnt take any good pics that you can actually see.

 review/summary: Excellent PDA phone, but not very durable
 review/text: I've used the treo 270 (flip up top) and the treo 600. I really like the 600 with all the palm features and programs that can be downloaded to the phone.With the 270, the flip up top broke off when it dropped from the kitchen counter to the floor. And now my 600 dropped from my hand to the floor(about 3 feet)and won't work any more. For such an expensive phone, it should be manufactured to be more durable.

 review/summary: Great palm/phone with limitations
 review/text: I transitioned from a regular cell phone and a palm vx to this treo 600. The 650 was not available at that time.This phone works great. It crapped out once and all data was lost (synch backup a week before). Otherwise it works great.Pluses:- Palm functionality integrated well with phone functionality.- SD Card reader- Camera- backlight keyboardMinuses:- Very slow data transfer via synch - instead transfer via sd card- low res screen- camera is pretty poor in quality, but comparable to some first generation camera phones- small keyboard buttons- need adapter to use headphones- very low volume speaker and poor quality speakerphone- No graffiti pad- Not bluetooth or Wifi (although I heard you can get a wifi sd card)I would highly recommend you get a nice case to protect this phone and screen protectors to minimize damage to the screen.

 review/summary: This might as well have been a toy phone
 review/text: I got this phone and put the money into it so that I could add some handy software and have an all-in-one piece. This was the most pathetic phone I have ever had. I replaced it a total of 5 times before I just made T-mobile send me a completely unrelated phone. I spent so much money to get so little. The phone with just lock up all of the time, would not get service randomly that was unrelated to the service provider, it would need to be reset daily and then would constantly have to be backed up in fear of losing information and having to do a hard reset. I do not recommend this phone for a toy for a baby, much less for a user who really wants to have some sort of function other than looking at the pretty buttons.

Design for hand free is bad...never fits well. Sound quality is bad.I would say you get what you pay for. The PDA is nice and all, and web feature is great if you don't mind a $120+ bill each month. Still for $150 the phone part is terrible. Now I'm stuck with it for another 18 months. UGHBuyers beware!

 review/text: The Palm Treo 600 has worked flawlessly since day one - if it would work with the CDMA system Verizon is on (the only service I get at our new house) I would definitely keep it, but its on GSM with Cingular/ATT which has incredibly poor service in my new area. If there is any service available this phone will pick it up where others wont. Add to it all the features this smartphone adds and its a great piece of equipment at a now killer price since the new models have emerged (& are having problems this older model doesnt). IMO you cant go wrong with this phone, and I have 3 other friends with the sale model that love it just as much.

 review/text: I have never had a screen protector before so I can not compare it to others, but this product works perfectly. I really like the fact that it is reusable which came in handy when I had to get my phone replaced. It is a little tricky to get it placed perfectly without any dust on the wrong side, but I think it is worth it none the less. It is fairly thick so protects the screen very well. It does not distort or blur the image at all. I will buy this brand again if I ever need a different one.

 review/summary: ONLY BUY BOXWAVE!
 review/text: So I got the Droid for Christmas... Awesome, right? My husband gets me a case and some crap-tacular screen protectors (NOT THESE AWESOME BOXWAVE ONES). He got ones that I have to measure and cut to fit the screen, including rounding out my own corners. They aren't reusable and before I get even get it down and on the screen, every microbe and fuzz particle in a 12 foot radius as attached itself to this thing. Not to mention there is no cut out for the speaker, so no matter how high I turn up the volume, it sounds like the other person is was in a can.Then I remember buying a BoxWave screen protector for my LG Dare, and from the day I put it on, I forgot it was even there... SERIOUSLY. They fit so seemlessly that when my husband inherited my Dare, the first thing he said was "I'm going to need a screen protector". When I told him there was already one on it, he didn't believe me! I bought the BoxWave anti-glare one for the Dare, and it had been on there for EIGHT MONTHS without one single issue. No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid. I bought the crystal this time... Once again a product perfection! 2 minutes and it was on and done. It comes with a lint free shammy to clean your phone prior to putting the protector on, an applicator card to slide out the bubbles, and clear instructions. The protector itself, has peel offs on both sides to ensure clean application. IT'S REALLY EASY. It's reusable, washable, no cutting, no sizing, no getting pissed off at air bubbles, and from the time you put it on, wiping off your "face marks" from the phone's screen is much easier. This is the best investment for your phone, of any brand... if Box Wave makes one for your model... BUY IT! I will never buy another brand again.

 review/text: When I wear this on my waist, the antenna pokes me in the side frequency, and eventually the antenna broke off, although the phone seemed to work just fine without it. Also when I lean over, my ribcage presses the release button, causing the phone to drop when I stand up again. However, I wouldn't use a leather case since that would interfere with the car holster that my phone locks into via the indentations on the side of the body of the phone.

 review/summary: Cool design.
 review/text: The Nokia belt clip works like this: there's a round button about 1/4&quot; deep that snaps onto the back of the phone behind the earpiece end. This raised button clicks into a short slot in the belt clip part, which fastens securely onto your belt or pocket. Because it's round, the button-like clasp mechanism allows the phone to swivel, so it doesn't dig into your side or leg when you sit down. (At least with a 7100-series, anyway.)There's a little spring loaded button on top of the clip (the photo on Amazon is really upside-down) that disengages the round clasp and lets you pop out the phone. The design is pretty clever, and it works well. The swivel mechanism allows it to stay semi-secure even while driving. I can't speak to the durability of it, because I've only had it a week. But I like it a lot more than the standard, hard-mounted clip.

review/text: I've been using this clip on my Nokia 6160 for around two years and would not replace it for anything! I'd tried a leather carrying case but found that the clip was centered too low on the phone -- when it was on my waist, I was poked by the antannea. This clip rides high on the phone making it perfect for the belt, or clipped to the inside of my bag. The fact that it is not adhesive, but fits into the case of the phone makes installation easy. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, easy way to access their phone.

 review/text: I bought this clip because I wanted to carry my cellular on my belt.The basic design is good - the phone is held in a convinient position on my belt and didnt bother me when I sat down in work or in a car.There are two main problems previous reviewers mentioned which caused me to stop using it completely.The first one is that holding mechanism isnt strong enough, and the phone would sometimes get released when I sat down - nearly lost the phone in meeting rooms and company taxis a couple of times.The other one is that it once broke my phone's back panel, which forced me to take the phone to a service center. Lockily I bought both the phone and the clip from Nokia, so they fixed it without charge but I still had to spend a couple of hours travelling to the service center and waiting in line for the fix.I resorted to using a leather carrying case - not ideal but doesnt break the phone either.As for the guy who wrote the oldest review, I guess he carries his phone in a briefcase and relies on hearing the phone's ring rather than on vibrations.

 review/summary: You can't buy this -- you can only lease it for 1-2 months
 review/text: I've gone through about seven of these clips in the last two years. I can't warn you enough -- don't buy this, because you're only getting a short-term lease.I broke most of them while sitting down in my car. It turns out that it doesn't take a lot of force placed on the bottom of the phone to torque the clip apart.I'm here on Amazon searching for a sturdier solution, but in the meantime, the phone stays in my pocket.

 review/summary: convenience that broke down under pressure
 review/text: I found that this clip, after only a few months, stopped holding the phone very well. Then, after about 6 months, the piece that attached to my phone RIPPED a section off of the back of my phone. Fortunately, the phone was still under the original manufacturer's one-year warranty, but I have been using a standard case ever since.

 review/summary: Expensive for how long it lasts
 review/text: This clip is definitely useful, but it could be made better considering how much it costs. The flat metal spring that held the clip closed over my belt slowly deformed over a couple months, so the clip didn't close any more and the whole thing just fell off my belt. I found cheaper ones at my local electronics superstore that didn't do that (but broke other ways). If you want a belt clip, this will work, but you have to face it...this isn't the last one you'll buy.

 review/summary: needs improvement
 review/text: Cell phone easily gets pushed up and disconnected from holder when worn on the belt and you sit in certain chairs. Lost my phone just this way and because of this product. Luckily found it later. Nice idea, but it needs improvement in design and those of us who purchased one of these should be provided with a re-designed product.

 review/summary: Maybe a little fragile, but still worth getting
 review/text: I think it's very convenient, and I like the easy and secure click-in, click-out functionality. Like many complaints here, I've broken one in the last year (I twisted it getting out of my car with it). I just brought it to the Cingluar store, and they replaced it, no questions asked, no receipt requested. I'm guessing this happens with a certain degree of regularity, and since it costs them about 28 cents to make these, I don't think they mind replacing them. If there's a better option out there for the 7100, I'd love to know about it.Warning - if you've got a nice belt and actually plan on clipping this thing to it, the clip will damage the belt over time, and wear off the leather finish. I just clip mine to my pocket now, although I'm sure if I were to line the inside of the clip with felt or something, it'd be better. Get one - you'll like it. And if it breaks, bring it back to your phone dealer and get a new one.

 review/summary: Body Glove CellSuit Neoprene Phone Case for Ericsson Phones
review/text: This is a &quot;must have&quot; accessory for your cell phone if you enjoy the outdoors. The case protects your cell phone from rain, sleat, snow, dust and the sun when your out and about. I enjoy sailing,biking and photography and this case protects my phone from all the elements, not to mention the odd drop. The case has a very strong belt clip that dose not bend like the metal ones, the cover has a snap to keep it closed and it has a pocket on the inside that you slip the cell's flip into so when the phone ring you just open to answer. I gave the case a 4 because of its only falt, that it the small slit in the bottom of the case that allows you to plug in accessorys without taking of the case, it has not reinforcing round the slit so it just rips through time. So Body Glove how about some stitching round it like a button hole????

review/summary: Great idea, terrible product.
 review/text: Ever since i first switched to the iphone my biggest complaint was the lack of a physical keyboard. when i got the iphone 5 i thought it was the time to finally take the plunge. i saw there were a few option but i was hesitant on some the cheaper priced items because i wanted something with high quality. i rather pay more up front and not have to worry about issues in the long run. so i passed on the $30 options and found the "premium" $100 option. the boxwave keyboard buddy. bluetooth keyboard, backlight keys, 2 week batter life, slim aluminum profile... it was exactly what i wanted. looking at pictures of it online my mouth watered.ready to take the plunge i was dissapointed it didnt come out for another month. (10/27) finally the end of october came and it was delayed to my disappointment. (11/16) that thursday (11/15) i placed my preorder. the weekend went by and the product page still showed a preorder status (shipping 11/16) despite the fact it was the 18th! finally that wednesday i get a notification my order shipped that monday (11/19). checking my shipping status was also a dissapointment because it rarely updated. after much confusion with ups and the post office my order was delivered on the 28th. must have came from china i thought, despite the fact that it claims my order started in washington. opening it up the packaging was cheap but who cares! the case felt as good as it looked! i let if fully charge before i used to so i wouldnt have to worry about it for the rest of the week. i enjoyed that case for a whole day and thought it was the cat's pajamas.soon to my disappointment i found it started having pairing issues after one day. i couldnt get it to sync for long periods of time. and it only got worst. now it only syncs long enough for me to send one message before i have to re pair it. i cant tell if it the fact that the battery is dying but that couldnt be true, could it? they claim 2 weeks of moderate battery use so in my mind thats 8-10 days real world use.... but its dead after 4 days? sounds like a company you could trust! so today i started exploring the website to find out about how to get mine swapped, maybe its just a bad one. while searching i find "Boxwave's Warranty Policy." How long does boxwave guarantee their products to work? 2 years like a good company should? nope. 1 year like most companies now a days do? nope. 100 DAYS! 3.5 months.... do you know how short that is? that is the same warranty comapnies offer on REFURBISHED products! so boxwave believes there $100 case is as good quality as a product that breaks and is then "fixed" and sold at a lower cost. its as good of quality as a used car sold by a used car dealer. A brand new premium product with the guarantee of a lower quality warranty. scary. even if i did swap mine out, i started having problems day 2, what happens on day 101?(3 months 11 days, not that far away) i go buy another $100 case? or do i reminisce of day one where everything was perfect and ignore the $100 other days of hell?stay away people. this is a $10 cases components wrapped in a $50 case shell sold for $100 and backed by a 100% satisfaction guaranteed refurbished warranty.FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO READ AND JUST SKIM TO THE BOTTOM I WILL SAVE YOU TIME:CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

 review/summary: Good idea...bad execution.
 review/text: No...just...no.I was excited to try this the keyboard out. The case itself is actually ok. It's a little blocky, but hey, what do you expect when you connect a keyboard to your iphone? I actually like the design. With that said, I had problems plugging the USB into the case, and also had sync problems after charging the keyboard fully. The spacebar on the keyboard does not click, so you never knew when you pressed the space or not. I often found myself clicking it two or three times...I also thought the keyboard was sort of flimsy and felt "cheap". This probably has to do with the fact they wanted to keep weight down, but I felt like if I dropped the phone with the keyboard open that it would break very easily.I think with some tweaks this keyboard case could be awesome, but this model isn't for me. It's not worth $80. At most I'd pay $45 for an item like this. With improvements it could be worth the $80, but as it is now...no...go another route.One big positive are the customer service people at BoxWave. I ordered my item directly from BoxWave, and the return process was easy and straight forward.

 review/summary: bad experience
 review/text: had a bad experience getting the product from box wave. I had been looking forward to receiving the product, but am really dissappointed with the product. Is very poorly built and also very heavy. The usb port is placed or manufactured incorrectly so you have to tilt and push the charging cable in. The space bar does not press (click) as the other keys, which is also poorly built. I am also experiencing sync issues. If you press a key once sometimes it stays pressed and you get multiple letters of the same key which could be a fault in the key or sync issue. Over all, its a waste of money

 review/summary: Too crammed together, not useable
 review/text: I am a longtime Blackberry user and was hoping this keyboard would help when typing long emails on my iPhone5. I couldn't get used to it and ended up just not using it at all. The tiny keys are lined-up in straight columns, too close together and the space bar is too narrow. It could have been much more useable if they hadn't tried to tried to cram so many functions into such a tight space. Give me just the basic alpha keys with function keys to get special characters and I would have been much happier.

 review/summary: Doesnt stay synced, rip off
 review/text: CONTINUOUSLY have to pair/sync this with my phone. It will stop typing mid sentence, then I have to turn the keyboard off then back on with the cheap, hard to move switch. This will happen about every 5 or 6 words typically, but can range from way more to way less. Whats way less than 5 words you ask? Pressing one button and have it continually be entered on the screen since the connection was lost, then having to erase the repeated letters that were entered, then the delete key does the same thing erasing possibly your entire message. This happens even right after its been charged, so cant be the battery.Id expect more out of such an expensive product. Having an extra thing to charge every couple of days (NOT 2 WEEKS) is an extra annoyance I'd be willing to put up with if this thing worked. This has driven me to sell my iPhone and buy a smartphone with a keyboard built in (Droid 4). If you need a keyboard, buy a phone that has one already.

 review/text: I had this product for two weeks and starting having problems. Blinking yellow LED, solid green LED during charging, but it would not hold a charge. Finally a solid blue LED before its death. LED operation was not described in operator's manual, so I had no idea how to troubleshoot this problem. I sent 3 E-Mails to Boxwave customer service, and have not received any response. I got their phone number (425) 828-6641 from the BBB, but their voice mailbox is full. Really? Who sells a defective product and completely ignores its customers? Boxwave will probably be out of business in a year, because customers don't tolerate this type of service. Stay away from Boxwave!

 review/summary: Nice idea, but...
 review/text: Pros: Easy to set up, seems like decent battery life.Cons: Clumsy, some keys hard to push, you lose all the auto-correct and shortcuts that come with the on-screen keyboard. Sucks to type with it on a screen that doesn't rotate horizontally (Facebook).Honestly, Boxwave should've made this thing feel and operate like a Blackberry keyboard since I suspect that's the majority of people who are going to buy this.Once the thing is paired, you lose the iPhone's autocorrect feature as well as time saving shortcuts like the auto capitalize after a period and double space to leave a period. Something Blackberry users are accustomed to.I would say, if you're buying one of these because you don't want to learn how to use a touch-screen keyboard, the time you would spend learning how to cope with this thing would be better spent actually learning how to use the touch-screen keyboard. As a long-time Blackberry user, my biggest fear was moving to a touch screen and losing a physical keyboard. But now that I've used an iPhone and grown accustomed to typing on it.. I don't think I can ever go back to a Blackberry.

 review/text: Can't fault the product, nor the vendor. I am a newbie when it comes to iPhone. LIke most use to the fruitberry qwerty keyboard, the switch to iPhone is a difficult one. So was recommended this extension. The problem is more the design, than the apparatus or build. Hard to type the top qwerty line, as the phone interferes. So for the newbies, don't assume this will be the answer.

Now that I have it, there are a number of reviews indicating that it suffers from bluetooth connectivity issues.

I preordered the item but I have to chase it a few times before the manufacturer ship it, needless to ship, arrived way after the original schedule delivery date. Then the USB connector was loose so I cannot charge it properly (I can understand there may be production glitches and that's life) but the really annoying part is the service, I contacted the manufacturer nearly a week ago and I am still waiting for their feedback, may be they forgot they are suppose to turn around within 48 hours. Anyway, I still have a defective unit sitting on my desk and I am still using the Apple onscreen virtual keyboard.... Not a great experience.

 review/summary: Very Disappointing
 review/text: Like others, I thought the higher price of this keyboard would equate to higher quality. I was wrong...very, very wrong. The keyboard itself is flimsy, much thinner than the $24 competitor I got. The power switch is incredibly flimsy, I can't tell if it's on or not. The keyboard seems much looser than the competitor when closed -- it's not very comforting. Tactile feedback is not as good as the cheaper alternative. And somehow, this keyboard drains my battery like crazy -- sending several short text messages with no other activity took my phone from 100% to 92%. This behavior happened more than once, and again the alternative does not show the same behavior. Even the charging port is flimsy, I really had to work to get the mini usb connector attached, and was afraid I was going to break it.The only reason this isn't one star is I have not experienced the pairing issues others have described. Price to quality ratio would make this less than one star, especially since all these issues are corrected in an alternative that costs a quarter as much.

Like any other keyboard, it will take a while to get used to typing on, as well as learning the appropriate commands and shortcuts. I believe over time, once the keys become a little more worn in, this keyboard will feel just as comfortable as my other keyboards from previous devices.Although, the only concern I am having with this product overall, is when the device is moved you can hear a light shaking sound; meaning either something loose inside the device or just the design of the keyboard itself causes this sound. Other than that, this is an overall great device.Lastly, I haven't had any issues with the bluetooth pairing or with the sync with the bluetooth device itself. This keyboard is very light and thin.. so don't drop it. I hope my review helps anyone looking for a keyboard, just be aware if you are looking for the "perfect" iPhone keyboard, this probably isn't what you are looking for.

 review/summary: Poor battery life, poor customer service
 review/text: The biggest downside to this keyboard isn't really the fault of the manufacturer; Apple will not allow external keyboards to use auto-capitalize and auto-correction features. Beyond that, however, there is only one shift key on the left side of the keyboard, making it impossible to capitalize half of the letters easily. Also, the keyboard jiggles a bit when it slides back under the phone. I have tried to begin the process of returning mine, but customer service has not responded to my request nearly one week after I made it. Bottom line: if you want a physical keyboard, you probably shouldn't have an iPhone in the first place.

review/summary: Best Protection for a Great phone
 review/text: Being a person who like to protect the items I buy, I searched around for the best product for my new Samsung 8500 phone. I started looking at the Samsung branded leather case. It did not seem to fit well or have great build quality. The clip on back adds to the thickness and does not serve as a great belt clip.The second unit that I considered was from Vaja (www.vaja.com.ar). While it is a good quality product it does not work well with the extended battery pack(not designed to). It has a great belt clip, although the stud on the back does concern me.I finally decided to get the Body Glove Cellsuit. I could not be more pleased. The quality of construction is good. The material is thick and allows me to feel comfotable using the phone. It works well with both the normal and extended battery packs. The clip on the back does add thickness to the unit. It does seem to work decently as a belt clip. The neckstrap is interesting as well. I would prefer a unit without the belt clip. The clip could be removed (cut off), but then you would lose the ability to use the neck strap.

 review/summary: Comfy AND cool!
 review/text: I had been hunting for a decent case to protect the pricey new Samsung phone I just bought, only to see a bunch of over-priced junk out there. Usually 2 inches of leather and mostly plastic that sort-of fit the phone...might as well wrap it up in a Zip-lock bag.Then I saw the Body Glove CellSuit...I asked the sales rep if it would protect the phone if I dropped it. Yep...demonstrated it by letting gravity do its thing on his own phone and it was so well protected it practically bounced. The CellSuit is completely custom-fitted for this particular phone and...well...fits like you know what. When the clam-shell is closed, all sides are covered except where the cell phone's jacks/buttoms are located. Better yet, when the cell phone is opened, the ear piece and area around the microphone hole are also covered...so no schmutz, spattle, make-up or whatever graces your phone after someone else uses it.The bonus is that it's comfortable to wrap up the phone to your hand or arm/hang over your neck with the included long strap and it's easy on your eyes, as well as your hands. Although I haven't used the small belt-clip attached to the back, it looks like it would be comfortable to wear. Bottom line...it fits and performs. And looks cool doing it.

 review/summary: A very worthwhile investment...
 review/text: Although this case is significantly more expensive than it's leather counterparts, the style makes up for the cost difference. I've only had the case a few days now, but already I am getting compliments. I'm usually not one to hype any product, but Body Glove gets kudos on this one. All the buttons and accessory holes are accessible, as though the case wasn't even there. You do have to use a car or portable charger that plugs into the bottom, but my desk charger was free anyway, so no big loss. Also, the strap is a very handy addition, and the belt clip works fine. If only every accessory product I own was as well matched to my phone as this case.

 review/summary: A great product!
 review/text: The Samsung SCH-8500 is my second cell phone. The problem I was finding with this phone and the one I had before is that the cases never fit the product well and make the phone too bulky. This case truly fits like a &quot;glove&quot; and it's quite compact. The cord to put around your neck is great too. I love having the option of securing the phone to my body without using the belt clip. This is a great case!

 review/text: Bought this for my new Samsung phone I just purchased from Sprint. The case is great. It works very well. The only thing I don't like is the belt clip. It could have been better. When you have it attached to your belt if you hit it on something it want always hold the phone. But the cover gives great protection. I would recommend this one over any of the other covers out there.

 review/summary: The best I have seen
 review/text: I have looked around quite a bit for &quot;the best&quot; phone case. The CellSuite gets the distinction. It fits perfectly, has obvious quality built in, looks good, and most importantly: protects the phone as well as the Secret Service protected George Bush when Dan Quail was the vice president. I dropped my phone in a parking lot tonight where it hit the asphalt and bounced under the car. No sign of damage to the phone or the case, not even a scratch. Why didn't I give it five stars? It falls just short of complete perfection when it comes to the choice of materials govering the earpiece. Stiffish nylon causes rubbing noise on your ear if you don't have the phone pressed tightly or held completely motionless. I'm trying to train myself in the art of not creating noise.

The only part of the phone left unprotected is the flip (earpiece) leaving it susceptible to possible scratching if you bump into something with the phone.

 review/summary: Great for listening, not for talking
 review/text: I found the earpiece, which is adjustable, to be comfortable and clear sounding. However, in conversations with others on the phone (and test messages to myself), I was barely audible at a normal conversational volume to both the other party on the line and voicemail.It seems to me that the microphone (which supposedly features noise canceling) is either too short for its intended purpose or is not sensative enough. I recommend another product that allows you to hear and to be heard.

 review/text: I don't like this thing at all. It's painful to wear -- the speaker is like a big round hard knob which doesn't squeeze well into my un-knoblike ear. Maybe if they made the speaker have a more comfortable shape it would work well, but it kills me right now. I also spend forever trying to get it on. At any rate, I prefer the Ericsson hands-free where it's just a soft earpiece you can just stick in your ear without any fumbling.

 review/text: Well, had 2 headsets in my hands. Plantronics M145 and this bodyglove.Put the bodyglove on, very comfortable, and I could hear the phone ringing loudly in my ear (good). Mom answered, and attempted talking.. After numerous Hellos? I unplugged the headset and told her I was testing a new headset. Plugged it back in, and after much adjusting and shouting realized it wasnt going to work for me. So, I told her to hold on a moment I was going to try it again.Plugged in the M145 and started talking, she asked me if I was going to try the headset again.I guess first things first, avoid the body glove. Second, get the plantronics if you want a good headset

You really have to put that thing in your ear. I'd say you can pass on this one but if this was your only option...it will do but you'd be better off looking into Plantronics since they have been designing headsets/mics for a looooong time.

 review/summary: A Painful Experience!
 review/text: I puchased this for the reason that; it hooked around your ear and, it had a small boom microphone which, I though would perform better than my Jabra earset. Unfortuately, I was wrong.Sound quality was pretty good but, in order to achieve that quality you have to get the earpiece firmly in your ear. This is where my pain came in! The hard earpiece had to be lodged in my ear in such a way that, after about five to ten minutes, I had to take it out because of discomfort. While I did use it I tested the microphone by leaving myself voice mail messages both at home and on my cell phone. The sound quality was poor. If I couldn't even understand the message I left myself, that's pretty poor.Overall, I could not recomend this for the reasons mentioned above. Save your money and, look elsewhere and, let me know if you find someting good!

 review/summary: Cheap junk
 review/text: Used this one for about a month and a half before it fell apart. The glue on the earpiece failed and now the speaker plug is hanging loose from its cheap plastic casing. The ear fit wasn't too comfortable either. I bought this because I didn't want one of those dangling mics, and this one looked less geeky than some of the other choices (like the Plantronics), but am now very much regretting my decision. btw, a coworker bought the Plantronics, and it has much better sound and build quality.

 review/summary: flawed design &amp; quality
 review/text: The design was flawed at best. It fell apart within 45 days, the ear piece came apart, the wiring became exposed at the earpiece, and the sound was lost soon after. The sound was mediocre. The only positive thing about it was the fact that it didn't fall off your ear. It really was a waste of my $$$$.

 review/summary: FINALLY! A COMFORTABLE headset that DOESN'T FALL OUT!!
 review/text: So far, I have bought 5 different kinds of headsets to use with cell/cordless phones. The BODY GLOVE EARGLOVE is fantastic! At first I was doubtful because of the brightcolored interchangable &quot;neosleeve&quot; covers..( I assumed it was a product geared towards kids &amp; therefore COMFORT was probably low on the list) Was I surprised! Earphone and mic has better quality sound than my other fav plantronics. It truely &quot;fits like a glove&quot; is extremely liteweight &amp; COMFORTABLE and most important of all: IT DOESNT FALL OUT WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD! Highly RECOMMENDED. [Now, if only they would design headset that fits my siemens cordless....] only works with 2.5 jacks...NOKIA 5190 etc.

 review/summary: Very disappointed!
 review/text: I could not wait to order this product. It looked great, had good technical writeups and reviews. When I did receive the headset I was very disappointed. I have a Nokia 8260 and the Body Globe 2.5 mm jack does not properly fit. The volume is so low that conversations are impossible. I already use the headset Nokia includes with the 8260 and it works very well. I was truely hoping for a more versitile and stylish headset. Instead I got a lemon with poor quality fit and performance.

 review/summary: Comfortable design, but no one can hear you
 review/text: This is a prime example of form over function. The headset itself is comfortable and form fitting. The earpiece sounds great if you find the sweet spot. However, the microphone piece does not pick up ANY sound - and this is after trying multiple sets. It was a great idea, but use some other headset instead.

 review/summary: How bad? Let me count the ways...
review/text: I bought one of these, and the sound was so terrible - both talking and hearing - that I sent it back. The replacement was just as bad, and over the course of the week, the whole thing fell to bits. It was completely unusable, and they wouldn't honour the warranty, saying I must have abused it. As much as I would have liked to, I was very careful. The plastic bits covering the electronics just fell off as I was wearing it.Also, in both cases, the ear thing was very difficult to set up for my ear and then to get on and off without screwing it up. If it isn't in just the right place, you can't hear.This is a REALLY bad product and a total waste of money. The idea is good, however. Perhaps a better company will make one that actually works.

 review/summary: Great mic, bad earpiece
 review/text: I have tried several different ones and this was the best sound I found. The mic did well with me and I have never had any complaints about the sound of my voice. I have tried it on several different phones and everyone says I sound fine. The speaker however, does not work at all unless you have it jammed in your ear and that was not comfortable at all. I could never get this to fit on my ear right so being of the mechanical mind that I am, I cut part of it off and added a piece from another headset. Now I have absolutely no complaints at all with sound. Honestly though, skip this and get something a bit better like from Plantronics.

 review/summary: The best I've tried!
 review/text: This is without a doubt the best handsfree cell phone device I've tried. I've bought: 1) the Nokia earbud ( yech, it's stuck in my ear!), 2) the ABSOLUTE JUNK GE/Sanyo headset with the &quot;D&quot; shaped thing to go around the ear (dadgumit, it fell off every time I tilted my head slightly!), 3) and the Jabra earpiece (not any better than the Nokia earbud, I don't care how many shapes the earpiece comes in, you have to stick this thing in your ear and hope it won't fall out).The Bodyglove product works, and works well. There are 2 small holes on the microphone stalk towards the end, make sure you don't cover them up with the decorative foam piece, it ruins your outgoing voice quality.

 review/summary: Very nice! Better than Nokia &amp; Andrews
 review/text: I like this earpiece. Better than the Nokia and the Andrews version.Body glove fits snugly around my ear, you can bend the ear bracket to fit eactly, and the earpiece is very good quality. At first, I started shouting, cause I was afraid with the tiny mice up by my cheek it wouldn't be loud enough, but everyone I talked to said &quot;why are you shouting&quot;. I think it works even better than the Nokia phone. I can set the phone to auto-answer my calls, and I don't have to worry about getting brain cancer cause I'm not holding the phone up to my ear all day. Now I'll just get hip cancer, from carrying the phone on my belt. :-) Plus you feel like a CIA agent, with this earpeice tucked around your ear, people look at you like you're undercover. It's really funny when you answer a call and start talking, and people think you're talking to yourself. I don't have much use for the different color mic wraps, but if I'm ever in LA, I'll make sure they match my leg warmers (ha ha) :-)

 review/summary: Looks good and falls apart about as well
 review/text: Okay, I'll be nice, the thing does look good and the sound is exceptional (transmission and reception), but the comfort level, which was what I thought would be great coming from Body Glove, was horrible. I twisted and bent the arm that goes behind your ear to perfection and I still never felt like it was going to stay in place. The thing is VERY light, which should be a good thing but I felt it moving every time I did. Finally the darn thing just fell apart. One minute I am talking...I get home, tell my friend I will call him back, I disconect it from my phone and go to take it off my ear to find that the receiver bit is still in my ear!!! To the trash it went. Buy the. Yes it looks wierd but it fits, sounds great and the rubbery ear thing rarely comes off. It does come off but not enough to bug. Either way avoid this product.

 review/summary: Looks cool but doesn't work very well (for me).
 review/text: I was very disappointed with the earglove. It looked so cool with the interchangeable foam covers and all, but I just couldn't get it to work for me. The build quality left a lot to be desired, and after several attempts to fit it comfortably, it sort of came apart, although I managed to get it together again. Then I just couldn't get the earbud thing to fit in my ear; if I stuck it right in it was very painful, as it's not padded, and if I positioned it hovering outside my earhole, I could hardly hear a thing, especially when the car was moving. I had much better luck with a competitor earpiece which looped right around my ear, and had a broader speaker cover which sat outside my earhole and gave plenty of volume. Another irritating thing about the earglove was the mute button, which if your phone is not compatible cuts off the call instead.I don't want to be too harsh since I think with these ear-thingies its just a case of finding one which fits the shape and size of your ear best. Maybe the earglove would work well for you. Its just a shame you have to buy one to find out. Maybe a friend has one you could try for size first, because if it doesn't fit it will be useless.

review/summary: The best earpiece I've found
 review/text: &quot;The best I've found&quot; doesn't necessarily mean this product is perfect. However, it has a piece that fits behind your ear, so it doesn't just fall out, like plain ear buds do (I must have funny shaped ears, because I just can't get those to stay). I will admit, the first one I owned did fall apart (the rubber ring came off the earbud and wouldn't stay when I put it back together), but I chalked it up to my fooling around with it and trying to add other parts to the ear bud to make it more comfy. So I bought another, left it as-is, and I've loved it. I have owned other behind-the-ear headsets, but none is as comfortable.As to sound quality, I've never had problems hearing the other person and I've never had complaints that they can't hear me when I'm wearing this headset.In all, once you find the trick to keeping it on and then leaving it alone, it'll stay on for HOURS. Believe me, I've had to wear mine for hours at a time.

 review/text: (Note: I tried this with a Nokia 5150. Your mileage may vary.)Comfort is poor. Getting it to fit snugly takes a bit of practice, and the ear bud starts to get uncomfortable after 5 to 10 minutes.Reception is OK. Sound is loud and clear, but seems to be susceptible to interference from other RF devices (portable phone, stereo, computer, etc.)Transmission is very bad. I tried calls to several different people. All complained that they could barely hear me speak. I finally gave up on it.Styling is great, but that really doesn't make any difference when you can't use it.

 review/summary: JUNK - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT (subtle enough?)
 review/text: I've loved Body Glove products since the late 80's (and I even own a Body Glove PDA case), but a little piece of neoprene does not a Body Glove product make. The one thing I do like about it is the fact you can wrap it around your ear when you aren't talking, and (like most similar products) it is very uncomfortable when inserted in your ear.After using the product occasionally for about 2 months, the speaker part of the headset simply came out of the housing. I tried 3 or 4 times to put it back in and get it to stay, but it kept popping out. After wrestling with it for a few days, the speaker finally quit working. I went to the incredibly weak Body Glove web site and sent them an e-mail asking about warranty, etc, but I never got a response. Figures.If I buy a .... product, I expect to use it longer than a few months. And, if I have a product that I have problems with, I at the very least expect a response from the manufacturer.Body Glove suckered me for [what I paid]. Never again.

 review/summary: Better than Ericsson hands-free (updated)
 review/text: I wrote a review before, It WAS great. how things change the ear piece fell apart and now the headset is useless. I adjusted the rating downward. Beware.*****ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS******This model is far superior to the Ericsson hand-free model. I used the Ericsson hands-free and I was always straining to hear. With the Body Glove model I have no problem hearing or others hearing me.Also the Ericsson model has nothing to hold the earpiece you must shove it down your ear canal. Not good hygiene.Must have especially now as it is illegal to drive with a cellular phone in hand in NY

 review/summary: Not what it could be.
 review/text: My Startac was everything it could be so I blindly bough the T722i thinking it would be the same, what a waste. Its got the right hardware, but its the dumb things the software is missing that hurt. You can't sent address entries over the air like most other GSM phones. You can't select what type of clock you want (I find the cute analog clock to hard to read when its so small on only moderate resolution). You can't delete any of the pre-installed images (its my memory thank you). It has to little Java memory to be useful. The camera sucks. The clock is not displayed durring a call -- With such a huge screen and they don't even leave the clock on. The programers should be ashamed to have wasted the hardware. The RS232 camera is also a terrible afterthough.

 review/summary: Disappointed....
 review/text: Motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture. But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones. If you want a flip phone with good reliability and features, GET the SAMSUNG phone...... I am very supprised that Motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either. They are behind in technology.

 review/summary: DONT BUY!!!
 review/text: This phone should be less then free people should pay you to walk around with this phone. I have owned this phone less then 2 months and I take really good care of it considering, I wipe the screen off every time I'm done useing it I clean it each day, I even clean the lint out of my pocket before I put it in there but still for some reason lint and dust and hairs get under the screen in mine and my brothers and thats not the only problem I spend about 5 minutes each night just trying to get the phone to charge because the charger doesent clip in right or the phone just says unable to charge even of the phone hasent been charged for 2 days. This phone looks good on line and sounds like a great deal with the camera attachment but let me tell you its not. Take my advice and dont buy this phone it is a HUGE waist of money.

 review/summary: Pretty Good Phone
 review/text: I started out with the Nokia 3390.Man i loved my phone,but i had always wanted a flip phone. so i got the Motorola V66. Man i loved my phone,but then i wanted one with a camera attachment. So i got the Motorola T722i phone. It's an upgrade of the T720i phone. This is actually a pretty good phone to use. The features are cool. The included ringtones are pretty cool to hear,the only thing is that it is kind of low,even if its on the highes volume level. Also has voice activated dialing. Comes in handy alot. One thing that i did not like is that it only comes with 1 game,and it gets very boring. and you can only have 1 game on the phone at a time. What that means is that you can buy other games,but not from the tmobile website,from the motorola website,they offer great games,but you'd have to delete your current game to install a new one. another bad thing is the screensaver. the screensavers are cute and look pretty funny,but they'll only work if the phone goes idle for more than 1 min.and by then the backlight on the phone turns off,and the only way you'd be able to see the screensaver is if you keep the phone open since it is a flip phone,because if you close the phone,then open it,it comes back to the main screen,so there is ABSOLUTELY NO point for the screensavers unless you want to take a look at them. the camera quality is not excellent unless in light,but the good thing is that you can actually place pictures you've taken on the wallpaper,and they actually come out a little better,and look real cool there. now some good things are the phone's look itself. the sleek silver style says it all. the buttons are very easy to use and access unlike other phones. two side buttons allow for easy and quick access of the phones volume,whether it be ringer volume,or talk volume.while on the phone,it sounds very good,and very loud,sometimes have to actually lower the volume so others cant hear my conversation with the ohter person. external caller ID is great.Personlization is also great,change colors of the screen,or the menu type. very handy feature if you like changes. Service is VERY good with the phone,although for some reason, i can NEVER talk longer than 2 hours,cause it always ends the call. it always ends the call at 2:00:01 talk time,maybe it's just mine though.Battery life is very good,even talk time.and charges pretty quick. GREAT PHONE TO GET if looking for a cheaper version of the other camera phones,very nice phone.

 review/summary: it's just an upgrade
 review/text: I purchased the T722i from the T-Mobile website. It's a great phone. It's a combination of Motorola's T720 and the V60 models. The T722i has a camera attachment and one should be very careful as not to lose it. Aside from the camera attachment, it has a number of good features that other cell phone manufacturers have not produced yet. It's very compact and light. A large LCD with color is also a plus. If you plan on getting this phone don't forget to get a case for it to protect the large LCD screen which is very fragile meaning don't get any water or perspiration on it. Overall, it's a great phone and can be a great topic during a conversation.

 review/summary: Great Phone
 review/text: I have had the phone for a week. So far it has been great. Need to charge the battery about every 2 days. As just a phone is great. Calls are loud and clear, and get good reception, although that is mostly due to t-mobile. The camera is more of a toy, and the pictures are just ok. But if you keep the camera attachment on your keychain, then its good to have for all those times you wish you had a camera. Ringtones again sound ok, but the great thing is that they are just midi files, so you can use t-zones to go to any site with the midi's and dload rings for free, and there are some great loud ones out there. I have used the s105 as well. It's ringtones sound nicer, but are a propriatery format, so can only seem to get them from t-mobile for a fee. The t722i's screen isnt as nice and bright indoors as the s105, but it works much better in the bright sun (the s105 is difficult to see). Text input is excellent with motorola's adaptive input. Just type the #'s and a list of the possible words are listed at the bottom, most common listed first. I found it to be much better than the entry of the s105, which i would usually turn of the guessing and just hit the #'s for the letters in the standard entry. Overall I highly recommend the t722i.

 review/summary: Good phone
 review/text: This phone is pretty good compared to others. My girlfriend has a Samsung V205 and it doesnt seem to be much better. The keypad [is weak] for dialing and the battery life is awful. But the T722i is different. Sure sometimes it can be a little slow when you press a button but thats not a big problem. The T722i has great battery life... with up to 2 hours talk time a day the battery lasted about three days without charge.(The Samsung V205 cannot compare). The features are nice. With tmobile the tzones internet is not bad. The camera attachment can be better. It does need a lot of light but even then it does not give great resolution at all.Overall I am satisfied with this phone. T-Mobile is great. No problems with their network whatsoever.

 review/summary: Disappointing, overrated, but overall a good phone
review/text: From all the manufacturer descriptions and images, i expected this phone to be a state of the art powerhouse. this is not the case when I got it. The picture quality is absolutely horrible, but looks better on the PC. Whoever said that you could not save pictures you take with the camera as background images is not true. i have, and its great. The navigation is slightly confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it will be a pleasure to use. Just read the menu, some short cuts can be confusing since the navigation is highly iconized. The battery life is disappointing and the color screen is a bit on the washed off side, but adjusting the contrast can help a little. The phone has great looks, sleek, sexy, and has a boxy feel which is swell. the material used to assemble the phone looks great but has a cheap feel. The screen is large and i like the shiny border. The signal is good in CA with T-mobile. T-mobile has the best plans compared to other providers. The phone comes with many accessories, including the camera. The camera lens can be manually rotated so you can take pictures of yourself easily. The phone does take a long time to load, but patience is a virtue, and plus no one really turns their phone on and off very much. The games are entertaining, but please expect to pay more to download more. There is only one game! The ringtones are dissappointing, compared to my sony erricsson t300. To sum it all up, this phone is overrated, but it is not your average lil flip phone. it is flooded with features, but if you crave for more personalization, you gots to sacrifice some benjamins. This phone is ideal for a teenager.PROS: Large ScreenGreat LooksLots of accessoriesWealth of featuresCompact SizeGood navigation conceptLarge ButtonsGood for teens to personalize their phoneCONS: Washed out screenPicture resolution is terribleShort battery lifeA bit heavySlowYou have to pay for more personlization

 review/text: Buying the t722i phone at amzaon and transfering my existing t-mobile service was a breeze. T-zones is slow but useful. Camera feels cheap and does not attach to the phone snuggly enough which causes intermittent disconnect. As a cell phone, I love it. Color screen, good menu layout, feels, looks and sounds great. Lots of bells and whistles. Good battery life if you don't use the camera too much. Great belt clip. Overall happy with it after 1 month.I have looked at other reviews. I don't know why I have no voting buttons.

 review/text: I bought this phone in January of 2003. Since then I've had nothing but troubles with this phone.First of all, some technical shortcomings with the phone:1. Phonebook - You cannot perform a search on phonebook... scrolling tends to be very annoying.2. Ringer - NOT loud enough. I've missed numerous calls because of this reason. Ring tones are very low quality compared to Samsung S105.3. Software - Very slow to respond to button sometime.4. Screen - Not so good resolution. Camera attachment is just there to lure you in.5. Antenna - FREQUENT dropped calls from low signal...

 review/text: I have 2 cell phones and account (actually, I sign up tmo because of the cheap GPRS plan, that I can play internet anywhere I want)I have T720 (CDMA-Verizon) and T722 (GSM/GPRS-tmo), the latter looks better when the former can switch my favorite skin, technically, I think T720 is better, that the phone can sync with atomic clock (no adjustment, yeah!), and I can customize the banner and greeting, of course, Verizon has far better coverage (though tmo has better reception in my working area)personally, I don't like T722i too much, I chose it when I sign up tmo internet because I can share all accessories from T720 (except the skin), and I pefer flip phone (to protect screen from scratching, and button from mis-operation due to accidentally pressedhere is my results:reception: decent (I tested with Samsung S105)ease of usage: okay, the phone book button don't exist by default (!!!), I have to re-assignsound: not really good (T72x design fault), I suggest the user shound plug an earphone in stead of phone itself (included), and the earpiece don't have clear sound, and I have to align the earpiece right, but sound is still somewhat muddydisplay: it's okay, but not like on the box, it looks more simple, the clock is on the bottom-right corner, and the navigation button indicator is hidden till you push it, since it uses regular LCD (not TFT), the picture you can't expect too muchbattery: 2 days of standby with included battery, 3hr 30mins of data usage (talking time), the AC adaptor ..... it charges much slower than T720'scamera: the camera ....., it don't have enough light sensitivity (even with low light settings)data: the data cable used on T720 works as well, then I can use GPRS with my laptop, note: the phone side of the plug has a power tap, that you can plug the AC adaptor for hours of data usage without running out of batteryand one more, the TrueSync (included with data kit, 3.1 version) works with T722i too, but there's a problem to "copy" the phonebook btw T720 and T722ione more, the phone can work under heavy workload (used as GPRS modem 8-9 hours every day), I used to have StarTac, it was durable and reliable, T720CDMA and T722i look reliable too, just slow response, and feel both models are well-inherited from StarTac

 review/text: Don't make the same mistake that I did. The phone is why I signed up for T-Mobile (it really should be free..the resolution on the screen & digital camera is poor to say the least)..but what is the use of the phone when you can't even make phone calls during your "unlimited minutes." I am lucky to even have a phone call go through without receiving a "message failed" or "network busy" signal. When my calls do go through, they are usually cut off in mid conversation. I called the customer service center...and their response was...well yes we do know that this is a problem in your area but have no immediate plans of extending your coverage area. Now I am stuck with a contract and a nice phone...but no coverage. The coverage in my area is even listed officially as GREAT by T-mobile. AVOID T-MOBILE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 review/summary: Not great but better than most
 review/text: I actually own a 720i, which is almost the same phone. I have a few complaints about the phone, the screen rubs on my face during calls, the screen resolution is not as good as a couple other phones I've seen and the ring volume is no where near loud enough. Other than that, it's got great ringtones and you can download about a million more. I haven't dropped a call in the six months that I've it. The camera while not great, is still a lot of fun. I think that the battery life is not a problem, although I've read a couple complaints I don't have any. I just put a new full housing on it, black with silver flames, and it looks really really cool!It's not the best phone on the market, but it's still a very good one. I would reccomend this phone to pretty much anyone who wants a camera phone.

review/text: When I first got this phone I was very excited about it, but now I am ready to bail out from T-Mobile and get a different phone and plan.1) The coverage is lousy. As soon as you leave a metro area, you lose coverage. There seems to be no roaming option with T-Mobile, unlike other phone companies.2) The phone is an interesting toy, but the camera is unwieldy and doesn't work very well. The pictures are dim, blurry, and the screen has poor resolution. Altogether a disappointing experience.

 review/summary: Ok phone, gets way too dirty!!!
 review/text: I've had this phone for about 1 month now, and already there is dust trapped under the screen and it is almost impossible to get out. The phone features are ok, not the best. The major let down of this thing is that the screen gets dust under it non-stop making it impossible to even see the screen most of the time. I've tried taking it to T-Mobile, and they said they'd try to repair it, but if they broke it...they wouldn't replace it. That got me fired up. This phone is ok feature wise, but has a terrible build to it. DONT GET IT!!!

 review/text: I didnot want the camera but it came with the phone. I haven't used it and don't care to. But the phone itself is so much better than the verizon wireless that I had. I can use it in my house (something I couldnot do with verizon) in the basement as well as elsewhere. The signal is strong and clear. It is not very user friendly but the customer care have been very helpful

 review/summary: Stay Away from Motorola T722i!
 review/text: I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing this phone to choose another one! I have had this phone for a little over six months and have already had to have a replacement phone sent to me. This phone has horrible reception and will drop calls in the middle of a conversation. The color on this phone is nothing to brag about and the camera does not take clear pictures at all. For anyone thinking of buying this phone don't waste your money. I would suggest going with a samsung. They seem to get the best reception and have the best color. Don't waste your money on this phone, you'll be disappointed. I know I am!

 review/summary: Nice phone and service (sometimes)
 review/text: I just bought the phone about 1 week ago, the phone has a good battery life and lots of cool features. The thing I like about this phone is that when you send a Text message from AIM you are not counted for a whole text message. while with other phones if you send just a simple "hi" that is already 1 text message used.The thing I am [upset] about is that you can't download new games, I have tried soo much and you still cant. The pixelation is somewhat OK its not all that great and the Camera doesn't show good quality pictures.Overall this is a good phone, it has lots of nice features, lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers. T-mobile customer service is great also but they need to expand their coverage area.If you are looking for a phone to buy for just talking all the time then buy this one, because it does give good Battery life, I didn't have to recharge it for about 2 days and I was talking on the phone and I was on T-Zones all the time. Now that's a good .. battery life.If you don't like this one there are others like it out there, the T720i, T721i, and that's about it. ...

 review/summary: Best phone I've ever had
review/text: With this being my first wireless phone, I am extremely pleased. I was a little leary about buying a phone with rebates, but everything worked out fine. The features this phone has are amazing. The battery life is great, I let it charge for about 18 hours, and it hasn't been charged again, and it's been 2 days. The color screen could be sharper, but I can't really complain. It comes with a ton of ringers and sounds. Overall, this is a great phone. I didn't buy the phone for the camera, good thing because the camera is really [doesn't work very well], it takes decent pictures for a small screen, but like I said I didnt buy it for the camera.PROS- Compact size- Easily learnable (the address book might take you a while)- Chock full of features- Beautiful phone, very attractive- Wonderful Phone!CONS- Camera- Internal Antennae (no problems yet, but I like external)

review/summary: my favorite phone
 review/text: This phone is excellent. When I was first purchasing it, I was alittle skeptical of what to expect based on other reveiws. However this phone is my favorite. The only thing that I could have asked Motorola to fix is probably the camera, and maybe the speaker.Don''t get me wtrong. The camera works fine, except that if you are in a dark zone, the picture may not turn out good on the camera, but if you e-mail it to somebody, then the picture looks like it was taken from a digital camera (its that good)The problem with the speaker is that it does not play ring tones very loud, and the louder you play the ringtones, the more blury they get. A feature that I think is very cool is the internet browser. You can visit any web page you would like. All in all, I thik this phone is perfect for someone who is looking to buy a cheap updated camera phone with all the gadgets. I would rate this phone a 5 out of 5.

 review/summary: you will learn to love it..despite its flaws
 review/text: this cell phone is pretty good. the best part about it is its durability. being as clumsy as i am, i've broken about three phones in the course of four months and as much as i've dropped this one, it's still working great (although it is quite scratched). it's long battery life is also quite a blessing.however, this phone is probably the slowest phone out there--it takes a good while to turn on and even just scrolling through the phonebook takes a bit of time. the color of the screen is pretty weak, and the attachable camera is basically useless because it takes a really still hand and a lot of patience to get a poor quality picture. lastly, even when it's on the highest volume, the ring is drowned out by some of the newer samsung phones.however, this is the only phone that's lived through various falls with me as its owner (for ten months) and so i'll give it four stars instead of three (the last one is purely out of love).

 review/summary: a very nice phone
 review/text: I dont understand the many negative reviews on this phone. I have been using it for about a month now and I think it is a very nice phone. The first nice feature is that you can see who is calling without flipping the phone open. Secondly, reception is good (t-mobile) and the sound is clear. Thirdly, it is very cool looking, is light and feels nice in your hands. It is true that the camera is a joke but I knew that the first time I saw a picture of it. I have had no problems with the buttons being too small-lousy reception, etc. Overall, I would recommend this phone to others.

 review/summary: Good phone - with a few minor annoyances
 review/text: I bought this phone because I wanted a) a flip phone b) a colour screen c) a good price (for free). The fact that it came with a camera attachment was a bonus (although it's certainly not a great bonus). I've used this phone for a couple months now and these are some minor annoyances that I have with it:* as much as I wanted a flip phone, the screen gets pretty greasy from being pressed against the upper part of my cheek. I'm not sure if this is because of the size and position of the screen - but I find I have to continously wipe off the screen (especially before I let anyone use it)* sometimes there is a delay after pressing a button before it appears on the screen and sounds a beep. (my friend has also noticed this with the same phone)* there is only one game that comes with the phone (I think its a motorcycle racing game) - but it takes so long to load that I never bother to play it. (I would have been happier with a simple game like snake)* earbuds came with the phone, but some of my friends complain that they can't hear me well when I am using them (although, it's not so bad that it stops be from using them)* I thought the camera would be cooler than it actually is. The quality of the pictures isn't as good as I have seen on some other phones - and because it is an attachment - I usually never bother to carry it around with me so it never gets used.All in all, I think this is a good phone - and I am happy with my decision of purchasing it. Although the above things can be annoying, they don't bother me that much and I rate this phone 4 *s.

 review/text: I've had the phone for a month and the beginning was rocky but now that i've figured it out I'm very happy. Call quality is excellent. The only problem I had was with the SIM chip that refused to stay put, but once I fixed that it's been perfect. The ring tones are not optimal, my old samsung N200 was much louder and clear with regards to ringing, but right now, my only big complaint. Other little things, you can't put multiple phone numbers under one name in the phone book. The voicemail was a little confusing. But T-mobiles plans can't be beat and the phoen was free, so what can I say!

 review/text: This was an ok phone. Don't look forward to taking many pictures with your camera because it is terrible. All this phone is, is a mixture of a Motorola v60 and a Motorola t720. It is a pretty simple phone. If you have second thoughts about this phone, buy the Nokia 3650 or the Samsung V205.

 review/summary: Motorola leads the way
 review/text: I own a Motorola T722i from T-Mobile. Motorola has been a leader in the communications industry worldwide. They produce some of the best cell phones on the market. The T722i is very easy to use and you can customize it to what you want. The features sets it apart from other cell phones. It's a flip-open phone so you can fold it and it's a nice small size. If you want a phone that is packed with state-of-the-art features in a small size phone then get this phone.I would stay away from Nokia phones. They aren't built up to the everyday use. The phones are weak and cheaply made. Generally it's good only for kids who want to get fancy by changing the face plates. Nokia phones look like tv remote controls in fact, your tv remote is much better built then a Nokia phone.

 review/summary: A very disappointing, but still feature laden phone.
 review/text: I've been a T-Mobile customer for many years, but am very disappointed with my current phone-- the Motorola T720i (now called the T722i). My first complaint arose on my first call. The earpiece volume is very low even at maximum volume and some calls just have to be ended if they're being made in an environment with any background noise. Many other complaints followed. Most dealt with hardware quality. My 1st one had a flaw in the flip mechanism that caused the phone to think it was being flipped shut when it wasn't-- ending calls unexpectedly. The 1st and 2nd ones would routinely &quot;freeze up&quot; during calls. The signal strength meter indicated full strength and the call timer was still counting, but the person on the other end couldn't hear me anymore and was soon disconnected. This daily occurrence required me to contact T-Mobile and get a 3rd one of these phones, which I'm sorry to say still has the strange &quot;freeze&quot; problem. All 3 have had the maddeningly low volume as well. Resolution and variable light functionality on the camera attachment are horrible as well, as is the color-quality on the display in general. It just looks washed-out, almost black &amp; white at times despite adjustments. The good news is that Customer Service is great at T-Mobile and they always replace the phone when I have problems. Avoid this phone, however. I'm going back to Nokia.

review/summary: good phone. recommended.
 review/text: this is my first cell phone. I am quite satisfied. excellent signal (probably more because of T-mobile than the phone itself). Features are easy to learn and navigate with the accompanying manual. I quite like the camera attachment. It doesn't work well in doors (it has a low light setting which gives passable results). it's easy to position the camera len just right after using it a couple times. Of couse picture quality isn't top notch, but I never wanted to use it to take professional-looking photos. The results I got worked for me. All other features are pretty standard, and as good as any of my friends' phones that I had used. The color screen is big and clear, easy to read under strong light or in the dark. It's slightly heavier than some other phones out there.

That sure helped during my sociology lecture. BLAH. Also if you get t-zones (just another 2.99 added to ur bill) you can surf the net (including amazon.com) and download ringtones, awesome games, and really cute screensavers and wallpaper ( i have winnie the pooh) What the heck are you waiting for buy this awesome phone now!!!!

I returned it to the store where I bought (T-mobile) it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30, they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a &quot;previously used&quot; phone. After 5 replacements, I bought a NOKIA. The camera sucks, and the battery life and signal suck too.

 review/text: Are u kidding me. This phone has made me think twice about using motorola phones. It does have good colors and stuff like that but there are more cons than pros. First of all, I have sent my phone back to Tmobile twice for a new one because the charger keep getting messed up. The camera feature is just more than atrocious. If u are not outside, u probably will not see anything o the screen. It is also an attachment which means that u cant take a picture of someone without them noticing. This is why a phone with a in built camera is nicer like Samsung and LG and Panasonic. I would tell anyone: Dont get this Phone...

 review/text: Do not buy the phone for the Camera. If you are looking for a great camera phone, the picture quality of the Samsung v205 is Much better. However, I am disappointed with the battery life of both..The Motorola T722i is fast.. the color screen is not as bright as the Samsung-- (I cant help but compare the two). However.. iside for apearances.. the motorola has twice as manny accessories and features (including the desktop speakerphone.. and mp3 player addons) so if you are into little gadgets like those, its a great phone. OR.. you can wait until the new Sony Erickson gets to the US-- which has a touch pad face and the features of both without all the addons :-)

They did, but they failed to tell me that it was a refurbished model. It had dirt in the keypad. I had to vacuum it but it's still dirty.I went to a T-Mobile store and was told that they discontinued the T722i because there were so many returns due to defects.

It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. My biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly (each push of the volume button makes a beep). I loved that feature on my StarTac. Look elsewhere for a good flip phone.

Switching ring modes requires you to navigate to the ring styles portion of the menu system, in my opinion, you should be able to change this without opening the phone. Battery life is horrible, if this phone goes into analog mode, you might as well turn it off, because the battery won't last more than a few minutes. I'm considering re-activating my old Kyocera QCP-860 ThinPhone.

 review/summary: not that great
 review/text: Motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture. But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones. If you want a flip phone with good reliability and features, GET the SAMSUNG phone...... I am very supprised that Motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either. They are behind in technology.

 review/summary: PRICE CAN ONLY BE DROPPING
 review/text: The price dropped again. In my understanding it may indicate that this cell phone is an out-of-date product. This is my first cell phone and so far everything works, so I give it 3 stars.Good:- color screenBad:- no specific button to turn on the screen after it automatically turns off- is not small in size and is heavy- camera is useless- only has one game and it is boring

 review/summary: HORRIBLE NEVER BUY A MOTOROLA AGAIN
 review/text: Cons- Everything about this phone is bad......really bad. The sound for one thing does not sound like polyphonic it is very fuzzy and some of the tones in the songs downloaded from the T-Moble web site are missing (the sony ericsson t300 has better sound than this phone).The camera is svery bad on the screen of the phone unless you are outside with alot of light.The pictures will come out horrible until you send them to your computer then their ok. Their is only one game motoGP and that with the camera takes up all the memory (so unless u delete somthing you wont be able to add any more games). The menu screen is very slow to move.the colors are bad they are not that vivid and the backgrounds that it comes with it are dark and if you try to brighten the screen of the phone the picture turns almost white. The phone is very slow. I had to return my phone twice to fix the charger on the phone because it never charges and the camera it oftenly not detected.you have to put it in more than 4 times for both the charger or camera to work. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE FOR 2 REASONS THE PRICE OF SUCH A HORRIBLE PHONE (SHOULD BE FREE) AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PHONE.Pros- this phone are it is flip,changeable covers,battery life (can be better).This phone is reception is ok and the ear piece sound is good (can be louder).

 review/summary: Very nice phone.
 review/text: 1. My phone takes 25 seconds to turn on, from the moment I press the power button until I get to the main menu. Other reviewers have claimed that it takes their phone 1.5 minutes to boot up, I am not experiencing this problem.2. The phone is *VERY* light weight. And although it is light weight, it still seems sturdy and doesn't have that &quot;cheap plastic&quot; feel as some other phones do (such as Nokia). Compared to other phones (such as Nokia) this phone is above average in sturdiness, and is equal or lighter in weight to any other phone I have ever handled.3. The screen is very nice. The colors are bright and the screen is very large. Some reviewers have said that the screen is not as bright as other phones. When I first got my phone I noticed that it did look a bit &quot;washed out&quot;. I went into the preferences and adjusted the contrast from 3 to 4, and this helped quite a bit, now the colors look very nice. Some people complaining about the screen colors and brightness may want to set their contrast to 4 or 5.4. The ringtones are plenty loud enough, both the standard rings and the polyphonic &quot;megaring&quot; tones are loud. You can also adjust the ring mode to either &quot;loud&quot; or &quot;soft&quot;, then you can fine-tune the volume on a scale from 1-10. The ring mode is nice because you can very quickly and very easily lower or raise the volume without having to go through adjusting the volume one notch at a time. There is also a silent, vibrate, and silent+vibrate mode.5. This is a very nice looking phone. I spent about a month shopping around, both looking for a good deal and trying to chose a phone. I looked at a lot of other phones on the internet, but nothing really helped me decide until I went into a cell phone store and checked them out in person. After actually checking out a real working phone in the store, and also comparing it to some other phones, I decided to get this phone. My opinion is that this phone is, without a doubt, the best phone on the market as of August 2003. But dont take my word for it, and dont base your opinion by looking at pictures and reading the &quot;specs&quot;, go to a cell phone store and check them out in person. It is amazing how nice a phone will look in pictures but will feel like a cheap piece of plastic once you see it in person (such as some Nokias and Sony/Ericsson phones). Don't get me wrong, there are some nice Nokias and Sony/Ericsson phones out there, but I would say most of them are junk compared to this phone.

 review/summary: A Very Competitive Color Phone
 review/text: Well I just got this phone the other day and heres my immediate thoughts. Great price for the package (color screen, flip, camera, free headset, very useable belt clip). To go into detail, the color screen is good but not great. A friend of mine has the Sanyo 4900 and the color screen on that looks clearer during less light conditions but not as nice in highly lighted conditions. The headset works fine. The reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs. Call quality is better than the previous phones I have owned (old sprint one, and motorola startac). Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well. To sum up:Pros:CustomizableClear Quality of CallsVariety of Ring TonesBelt ClipVoice DialingCons:Color screen in darker settingsLack of variety of actual background pictures.Needs more memory.

 review/summary: It's OK...not that great!
 review/text: I have both this phone and the Sony Ericsson T68i and the latter is a lot better. The Motorola's screen has poor resolution. The colors seem pretty washed out compared to the T68i. Also, the T722i is very slow. It takes over 1-2 minutes to boot up when you power on and it takes the same amount of time to load the included game. The camera attachment gives poor results compared to some of the other camera-based cell phones such as the Samsung. It works poorly unless there is tons of light and even then, the picture quality is mediocore. I'm not impressed by this phone. the battery life is good (lasts 3-4 days with 2 hrs of talking per day and no charging). It comes with a nice belt clip. If you're looking to buy this because of the free camera attachement, get another phone (such as the T68i for free and buy the camera attachment for $19 on any auction site).

 review/text: I just got this, so maybe I haven't given it alot of time, but so far it is really nice. The reception is great and the phone is very clear when talking directly or using the included hands-free kit. It does take a while to boot, but I probably won't shut it down very often. The camera does not take super-great pictures, but I didn't get this phone because of the camera. To be completely fair, I have only viewed the pictures on the phone and have not emailed them to anyone. I have read that they look better when viewed on a PC.

 review/summary: Great Color Phone
review/text: This is a really good color phone, the only thing that really keeps it from being perfect (in my opinion) is that the phone it a little slow when responding to buttons being pressed. Sometimes if the phone is &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;thinking&quot; it will take 2 or 3 seconds to respond to a button that you just pressed. This is especially noticable when browsing the Internet using T-Zones.I am using this phone on the T-Mobile network and have not experienced any dropped calls, the voice quality is very clear and the reception is good. The battery life is very good for a color phone, it lasts me about 5 days of talking just a few hours a day. Of course you can buy an extended capacity battery, and that would add much more talk time because it's about 60% more capacity.The phone looks very cool, and I like that you can change out the faceplate if you so desire. The entire keypad lights up (not just the numbers on the key) so you can see it very well in the dark. The PIM software on the phone is good, although I wish you could store addresses too. The camera attachment isn't really worth much, mostly because the quality of the pictures is pretty bad. But it's good to have if you need a quick snapshot of something and don't have any other way to capture it. Although one nice thing is, besides emailing any pictures you take with the camera, you can also save them on the phone as wallpaper images.The belt holster that comes with the phone is really nice, much better than the one that came with my old StarTAC. You can leave the clip on your belt and just detach the phone if you need to use it, then all you hacve to do is slide it back onto the belt clip. Motorola also includes a neck lanyard that attaches to the top of the phone if you want to carry it around this way, it's a nice little addition.You can store wallpaper images, screen savers, ringtones and JAVA games on this phone as well. The only other negative thing I would say about this phone is that there just isn't enough internal memory to store games. I can get two games on it, maybe three, if two of them are under 20k. There is a lot of space for wallpaper images, ringtones and phone numbers, so there's no excuse for not putting more memory for games.All in all I would recommend this phone, especially if you can get it for a low price or for free. It's a very good (but not perfect) color phone with solid features. It does have some drawbacks, but then, no phone is perfect.

review/summary: Great phone
 review/text: I purchased 2 of these phones in July and I've been very happy with them. We got a great plan from t-mobile (nationwide 600 mins/$40) and this phone has been a pretty good performer. I don't use many of the features it has (internet, games, voice-activiated dialing, dig. camera)...mainly just for calling and talking. To those who say the picture quality is not good--IT'S A FREAKING PHONE! I've used it in the Pittsburgh area, Portland, Seattle, DC area and I've gotten good reception for the most part. Occassionally I won't get any reception in some buildings here in Pittsburgh, but it's not a big problem. Sometimes I will get reverb when I'm talking and the reception bar is the highest it can be, which gets kind of annoying. Another con is that the volume could be louder and its loudest level. Sometimes it's hard to hear. Other than that, it's been a good phone for me--a person who just wants a phone and not something fancy.

 review/summary: Does its job very well...
 review/text: I've been using this phone for the last couple of months and I've been extremely satisfied with it. I've used candy bar type phones for the last few years now and I've gotten very tired of having to use the kepad lock to prevent it from accidently dialing calls while it's in my pocket. A flip phone is truly a better design. Voice quality and reception on this phone are great. I've had some problems with volume in extremely noisy situations, but at maximum volume, I can still here the person I'm talking with very well. Voice dialing is a convenient feature. Sure the camera attachment quality might not be that good. Maybe the color screen is a little washed out like some people say. And, maybe it's a little slow booting up or loading games, etc. (though I really don't think it's that slow). But, I do not think these complaints are central to what the phone was built for. Battery life is good. Voice and reception are good. Interface very easy to understand. It's compact, designed well, and seems sturdy. Overall, it's a phone I know I can be satisfied with for the next few years.

 review/summary: Amazon is awesome, T-Mobile is alright, and FedEx is amazing
 review/text: I bought this phone on Tuesday with the 3-7 day shipping at about 11 o'clock at night. The phone was in my hands by 2:30 Friday amazingly fast shipping and processing done by both Amazon and FedEx(Amazon shipped from Texas and I live in Michigan). I live in a very small town and T-Mobiles service just runs along the main interstate highway but it is amazing the quality i am getting for such a small area. I mean i was in my friends basement pretty far away from the highway and was getting a signal strength of 3 bars which is pretty good for talking, When im in my house i get 6 bars. T-Mobile so far has made me happy...The phone is a work of art i mean its signal strength is probably the best ive seen. The battery charges amazingly fast in 3 hours and last a long long time. The typing system is awesome to sometimes you can type a whole name in without having to choose through the letters. The MegaTones have the best quality rings ive probably heard. The phone is pretty durable feeling and is small and light weight, can't even feel it. The camera is not that great on the phone and needs alot of light and not alot of movement to take a great shot, If you want a good quality look at it you need to have a connectivity kit to upload them on your PC then they look pretty good. I also love the color and the back lcd screen comes in handy alot. The game that comes on it is pretty high graphic and i can see why it takes a while to load other than that everything loads pretty fast.Voice dialing comes in handy but would be even more handy if you could have more than 5 at a time. Some people had problems finding out how to set the voice dialing. The reason for that is you have 2 ways to save your contacts on your phone book, 1 is on the actual smart card chip itself or on the phone. If you save it on the phone you can pick an icon for the number like if its a cell, home, work, pager, and so on and you have another line that has a voice dial part and that is where you can record for the voice dialing. Then there is the Smart Card part that can hold contacts but you can't put an icon of what kind of phone it is and you can do the voice recorder for it. Another cool feature is the fast dialing where each number on your phone book has a three digit number, you put the three digit number in and press pound and it will call it.I love this phone and plan on having it a long time.

 review/text: This is one of the fascinating cell phones I have ever come accross. Infact when I came accross the product it sounded as i was dreaming. It was until when I realized that I was viewing a cell phone that I understood what this was all about.I really do not know how this kind of phone can have have so many features and up to a camera. Mastering the use of a phone is interesting but understanding the functions is another thing. I intent to have this phone so as to be able to study the functions physically and understanding the whole show about the phone. One pertinent question I would like to ask is to know whether this phone can be use world wide. Actually I leave and work in Cameroon, West Africa and would really appreciate the acquisition of the wonder baby.How do I procure this phone?. What are the payment procedures. I can issue an America check which has to chased before the phone is sent to me in the address i will send to you when you give me the go ahead. I have never fallen in love with a phone as I have done with this Motorola T7221i phone w/Camera attachment(T-Mobile).

 review/text: I have this phone and i dont get good reception when im in buildings. The end call button stops working sometimes and you have to turn it off in order to end your call. It is cracking at the top part where it flips. My boyfriend had this problem when he had the motorola 720 and it broke, and he had to get a new phone. My advice is not to get a flip phone because eventually it will break and you will need a new phone. Also, the screen gets dirty easily and I have to clean it with windex. It only has one game and after a week you'll get tired of it.

You have to use the Datebook, and then there's no "snooze" to push.*Pretty lousy reception. I can't use it in my apartment, where I'm always forced to use my husband's Nextel. It works fine outside, so I find myself running out of stores and my apartment when I get calls.*The volume is low in the earpiece and also on the ringer. Even on "loud," I oftentimes don't hear it ringing.*This is a pretty slow phone, indeed. Don't plan on taking pictures unless you have a very steady hand and a subject willing to stay still for about 15 seconds.*The phone book doesn't store multiple numbers under one name, so you have a long list of names, one number per name.*The Moto game is lame.*Scratches very easily.

 review/summary: has its flaws, but has stood by--great customer service.
review/text: I bought the t722i as soon as it came out because it was free for signing up with t-mobile. initially the phone was ok...had sub-par reception indoors, but then after five months it started to blank out whenever you flipped it open or left it idle for more than 2 minutes. i e-mailed t-mobile and they sent me a brand new phone within 5 days with great apologies. i accidentally forgot the antenna from the box and sent it back with my old phone. again i e-mailed t-mobile and they very quickly sent me a new one. since then i have had phenomenal reception, i think they might have added new towers in maryland. at any rate, my reception is great everywhere, and my service plan is a great deal. all in all, even though my phone had issues, customer service is great (by e-mail anyway) and my second phone is perfect.i never use the camera so i can't comment on that. i don't like that the screen picks up all that cheek grease.if you get it for free or for 50 bucks or less, i think its worth it.

Like, voice-dialing, battery memory, etc. BUT, a big problem, and I'm not sure if this is due to T-Mobile or the phone, but the reception is horrible inside of buildings. If you are outside no problems, but in any house or building....good luck getting a conversation complete. I believe that T-Mobile has the best plans for the money and I am hoping that it is just the phone that is the cause of all the dropped calls.

 review/summary: Needs more volume
 review/text: I actually own the T720i, but I'm betting my comments are still valid for this phone... It is flimsier than I expected, but should hold up to my non-business use. The removable coverplates ~seem~ like they'll fall off, but no problems as of yet. The volume can not be &quot;cranked up&quot; enough and it has been a problem already. My old StarTAC could make ears bleed if I needed it and could act like a limited spreaker phone for two people to share in a conversation. The 720i just doesn't have the volume that I really like/need. I love, love, love the color screen, although navigation to various functionality is very inconsistent and not very intuitive. The only problem I have with the screen is that while I'm talking, it rubs the side of my cheek. I'm a well groomed person and practice personal hygeine (almost too much!), but I inevitably smear the screen with the oil in my skin and have to clean it after each phone call. The T-Mobile service is working pretty well for me in the DFW area. With these caveats, I feel comfortable recommending this phone.

 review/summary: Not ready to compete
 review/text: I upgraded from a Motorola V66 to get the option of color and the camera function. The colors are washed out and the pictures look terrible on the screen compared to the Sony Ericsson T610 which has more colors. The attached camera should have been built into the phone so you won't have to carry yet another thing with you or lose it (as I did). The pics do look much better on a PC. The speed of response to pushing buttons is abysmal and I have had to 'reboot' the phone on three occasions when it failed to function. I am using T-Mobile service and overall I am satisfied with them but not with Motorola who is coming out with the T725 which is not much improved as a camera phone over the T720i or T22i just a lot more expensive for those who have to have the 'latest'. For my money get the T610 from Sony Ericcson when you receive a call the picture of the person calling pops up on your well lit colore screen (if ti is in your files) instead of the call-id number. A nice feature that suprisingly Motorola doesn't have.

 review/summary: Not to bad....
 review/text: I purchased this phone as an upgrade from the Sony T- 300 which was one of the worst phones that I have ever bought. But it was free after rebates but I diffidently like the MOTO better this phone is great I paid a lot but it was worth it. The color screen is gorgeous. I get a signal with that phone when some of my friends don't, who have the same service (T- Mobile) as I do, with there stupid Nokia phones. Overall if you travel a lot then stay away from T-mobile. Is you don't and live close to a metro area then you are going to be ok. T-Mobiles coverage really needs to mature. If I go to far from Boise (Idaho), then I have problems. Pick Verizon if you can. They have the best coverage known to man it seems like.

 review/summary: Pretty decent phone - camera not great
 review/text: Having used this product for two months, including travelling with it, I have not had as much problem with call dropping as other people have mentioned. In fact, my husband and I have had problems with reception and call dropping from other companies (Cingular &amp; Spring) where reception on this phone has been clear and consistent. I have even been able to receive calls in concrete buildings, something other phones have not allowed.The battery life is decent, and having dropped our home landline, most of our conversations are via cell. I have been happy with the length of time between charges. The handsfree is clear and I have had no complaints from callers on the other end about not being able to hear me.Ringtones are distinctive; I also appreciate being able to have the phone on vibrate OR silent. I've always been a huge fan of Nokia, but this certainly supercedes all my Nokia experiences.The size and weight are great; the phone fits well (easy to talk into mouthpiece with ear in proper location); voice activated calls very handy - good voice recognitionDislikes: phone screen touching face when talkingCamera pictures are really quite blurry and poor qualityCamera makes noise when turning offStorage capacity for voice activated calling smallFYI not related to phone, but to T-Mobile - for the shared family plan, only one of the individuals gets TMOBILE access on their phone.All in all, I'm very happy with my new phone.

 review/summary: Great phone, great price
review/text: I recently bought this phone through T-Mobile by upgrading my plan. I got 50 instant rebate (for upgrading) and 100 extra mail in rebate. The phone is awesome, it takes great pictures and the resolution is pretty good. Many feautures, quality and great reception. The screen resloution can be better but this phone. its a must have for t-mobile customers, i have owned many phones, even the samsung v205 and the samsung has better screen resolution (picture resolution is same on all phones) but motorola has more features, samsung is durable too as well as motorola. i'd go with either one, but i prefer to use the motorola.

 review/summary: Good upgrade, but avoid T-Mobile
 review/text: This is a good upgrade from the 120. Better battery life and a slightly updated styling make this another solid phone from Moto. Designed in Asia (by a Singaporean contractor?) the phone has that unique Asian look, but at least it's got Moto's cool factor. Definitely not as weird looking as Sumsng phones, and much better quality (build and voice) than the latter.But I'm still not hot on T-Mobile. Count me as one of the many, many unhappy T-Mobile customers. Network availability is a HUGE problem here in Brooklyn, and network coverage is still poor in most of the country -- no signal in most of Connecticut or Florida. Even AT&amp;T has better coverage and they were late in the GSM game...

 review/summary: Worse Than &quot;Soup Cans &amp; String&quot;
 review/text: My favorite thing about this phone is the ability to use &quot;In Da Club&quot; as my ring tone. Unfortunately, that's all I like.For the first 3 weeks, it's fine...Then everything falls apart. The screen turns off, the antenna falls off, it switches to analog mode for no reason, the battery dies faster than most non-viagra users and the WORST thing is its refusal to charge. This piece of junk is so temperamental, you have to plug it in 12-17 times in order to get it to charge. Then 1-3 times a week, it will wait until you fall asleep, THEN stop charging - leaving you with a useless paperweight for your long day at work. And forget about replacing it, I've had 7 in the past year and they ALL fall apart. Plus, your wireless provider will pull some crap about &quot;warranty periods&quot; and &quot;upgrade charges&quot; even though your *most recent* phone is only a month old. Stay Away...far, far away.

I've had it for the past 8 months or so and I'm getting ready to trade it in for a new one for the third time.problems the phone often encounters:-end button stops working-randomly dropped calls-answer the phone to both the microphone AND speaker not working-screen not working so you can't tell who's calling-dirt gets under the screen very easilyI'm sure there are more. it's not all bad, but you're much better off with another phone.

 review/summary: There are probably better phones
review/text: I purchased this phone today and im not impressed. The color screen is good but nothing special. The digital camera takes awful pictures but using pictures as wall paper is a neat idea. I had a tough time deciding on the Samsung V205 or this phone but The Motorola T722i has the voice activated dialing( the Samsung doesnt) which was the deciding factor in this. If voice dialing isnt important go for the SamsungV205. The pictures are better and the color screen is better. The Samsung V205 may be more expensive but in my opinion the Motorola isnt even worth how much it cost.

 review/summary: The phone is garbage
 review/text: I got suckered in with the original price and then how much you get back when you sign up for service.1. Do not use T-Mobile. Nothing but problems and thier service range is horrible.2. I agree with the camera. It stinks.3. Not taking the charge is annoying. Sometimes I have to play with the phone for sometimes 20 minutes so I can charge it overnight.4. The phone is not durable at all and the screen turns all blue after opening the phone after it has been off the charger for an hour or so. The phone will not function right and I have to close it and wait for a few minutes for the phone to reset. My sister in laws does the same thing. The phone should not do this.Overall, I should have chose a little more wisely and know why they are giving so much back when you purchase the phone.

 review/text: The truth is, this headset looks and feels awesome. The bad part is, the mic is too far away. The person calling you can be heard pretty clearly. On the other hand you sound like you are ten feet away from your phone. As the power is drained this problem gets worse. However it seems to sound better if you use a Motorola phone with the head set instead of other brands of cell phones....strange. Volume controls are adequate, from a whisper to an ear shattering scream. Blue blinky light is capable of being turned off. All in all this headset does a pretty good job, as long as you are in a quiet room while talking on it.

 review/summary: Great case, if you only use you PDA as a phone!!
 review/text: It is a really nice case. The keyboard can not be used unless removing the phone from the case. This can't be accomplished easily. You must remove the entire apparatus from your belt, and pull the phone out. The case is so tight that when you take the phone from the case to use the keyboard, the case pulls the battery cover off. If you do not use the keybaord on a daily basis this is your case. If it is used daily, find something else. It also has plastic over the screen so to use the stylus it must be removed as well. If you are using the phone only, then get this case, otherwise, this goes in the box with the other 20 unusable cell phone cases I have aquired for this device.

However, I have three complaints: 1) the buttons are pretty small, and I don't have huge hands; 2) the part of the phone you speak into is not on the bottom, but just below the keys, so if you hold the phone against your cheek you sound very muffled; and 3) the screen just goes blank in screensaver mode, so if you leave and come back you can't tell from looking at it if you missed any calls or messages. update: you can press one of the buttons on the right side of the phone to get the time and show if you missed a call or text.

review/summary: promising phone but under delivered!
 review/text: I am very tech savvy when it comes to cell phones, and I must say the 550i looked very promising on paper: Quad Band, bluetooth, 2.0 MP camera with xenon flash, etc. But when I got the phone and placed the sim card, I noticed the antenna reception is far inferior to some other phones I have used, such as Nokia N73, or even Sony Ericsson K750i. I would routinely get "no reception" and would take the phone quite some time to pick up reception again. Other than the antenna issue (which is a big deal) the other features and functionality of the phone are superb. Nice tactile feel to the buttons, the menus and submenus can be accessed in a flash with minimal lag time. The software on the camera is not quite as user friendly as the K750i and i feel the picture quality is not as good either (even though k750i also has a 2 MP camera). Had I known what I know now, I would decline to purchase this phone again

 review/text: great service, i recomend seller. the only things with this item (nothing to do with seller) is that the buttons are sensetive, the internet browser opens up easily(while in pocket), to unlock the keypad is tricky, phone isnt really user friendly. phone gets great signal, speakers work great, camera works above average for a cell phone, will work with verizon, at@t (formally cingular), sprint, and alltel.

 review/summary: Great phone with a few minor annoyances
 review/text: The k550i phone is a great small feature-packed phone. The camera on the phone takes excellent pictures, suitable for making 4x6 prints. The phone has a panorama mode that allows you to stitch together 2 or 3 images with a very good stitch guide. Also, there is a nice image editor built into the phone that can do auto-levels, contrast, brightness, and a bunch of other nice tools. You can see many full size pictures by visiting flickr and searching on "k550i". The MP3 player works great ... sound quality is excellent, though volume is soft and some may find the max volume is too low. You will want to get a micro memory stick if you want more than a few songs. I like how the included headphones double as a handsfree set and transition from music to phone back to music effortlessly. I found creating a few playlists very intuitive and easy. Battery life is very good, even with lots of music/radio playing and picture taking. The radio features trackID, which takes a sample of the song you are listening to and looks up the artist, song title, and album ... actually have found it very useful(requires data plan). The web browser is a good WAP browser for basic use ... I like that you can change to landscape screen orientation browsing.OK, now for the annoyances: When the flash is turned on, the LED lights stay lit constantly, and they are very bright ... human targets usually complain. I was surprised that digital zoom for the camera is only allowed at VGA resolution, and not at 1MP. There is a workaround ... after taking a 2MP picture, you can zoom in on it and save the visible area to a new picture. I take pictures and immediately send them to flickr ... the phone presents a nag screen warning that the file is large, which cannot be turned off. The "take picture" button is a two-step button like most cameras, with a focus step then a snap step, but the second step takes a hard press causing you to shake the camera and get a blurry picture. Instead, I use the center joystick button on the face of the phone, which focuses and immediately takes a picture. Sending a picture as an email immediately after taking it requires some kooky steps: (press joystick in, select "view", zoom out one step, then select More->Send As->Email).Despite the flaws, I am very happy with the phone considering the price and features.

 review/summary: Good, but not there yet
 review/text: The pro's* very compact design, almost too small for my big hands, but over time one gets used to its dimensions, AND enjoys the small design. Fits into the front pocket of my jeans! The center button (the one which looks like a 5-way) and its surrounding ring (this ring has the four directions) feel very sturdy, they seem to be made of actual metal. The ring has four tiny dots of light, where four arrows could be, signaling each one direction, and look very cool when they glow along with the keypad, in dark environments.* I just changed to the K550 from my previous nokia 6820, which has an expandable flip qwerty keyboard, and missed the nokia keyboard at the beginning. However, the predictive text interface is almost perfect (read con's) and I almost do not miss the keyboard anymore. Predictive text also allows you to create your own dictionary entries (this is more or less a common feature of cellphones) and allows you to enter your dictionary to maintain it: edit or delete entries (this is very uncommon and useful!). The predictive text has several modes one of which turns on "national characters". when I sometime type a message in spanish, comes handy since it allows the use of spanish accents.* very large memory for contacts, and the fields used in contacts are very compatible with outlook, which means you will not lose data when synchronising your contacts into your PC. When I synchronised with outlook from the 6820, the mapping of fields was different, so one got lost or misplaced information in the process.* at 2 MPixels, very good definition for a camera that is always with you, for that spontaneous snapshot.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -the con's* the chrome finish of the center ring is starting to wear off after only three months of use! the entire surface of the ring, starting with its perimeter, is wearing thin and leaking blue light. looks cheap and old, too bad for a set this expensive.* The "national character" feature behaves strangely, in the sense that when I turn it on, it changes the message length limit from 160 down to 60 characters, for no good reason. And when you turn it off, the limit is still there, you would have to start a new message from scratch for the limit to be 160 again. Also whe you turn teh feature off, the phone "forgets" the words one has created with spanish characters, literally hiding a portion of your custom dictionary. I dont think of these as design flaws but more as software bugs, but they are real, limiting and annoying.* the light of the camera, two very bright and white LEDs, is good as a lamp to fing your way walking through a dark place, but is a terrible, almost useless flash for taking pictures in the dark, which is what it's suposed to be. The camera works well only under good natural light or decent room lighting. Not worthy of the cybershot name.

 review/summary: Very happy with it - highly recommended
 review/text: I had a Sony S710a which I unlocked when I was in Prague, but it was not a quad phone and I had problems when I travel some countries like Turkey and Poland. So I decided to purchase a small quad phone which is AT&T; compatible. With K550i I found the phone I was looking for. It is doing everything S710a was capable of and more much more. The reception quality is very good. I always have more bars than my S710a at the very same places. The Gmail client, Google Maps client and Opera Mini version 4 (great browser for a mobile phone) works flawlessly - can't run Yahoo GO (it display the wierd message of not available memory, even I have 67Mb on the phone) but who cares. With AT&T; unlimited media package, I can surf the internet, use Jajah for VOIP international phone calls and more. Picture quality of the 2MP camera is very good, have a 2GB miniSD card and have no problem with spacing. Have not used the radio too much but it is there if you want to listen your favorite FM station and it requires carrying the plugin cable/head phones. The commercially available or free application for the phone are numbered. But I have been using it as a router to the internet via bluetooth and my Microsoft Vista Dell XPS 1330 laptop - because AT&T; unlimited package on the cell phone plan (only 20$ per month), it is an excellent way of using your laptop anywhere. I am also planning to purchase the new Nokia N810 web tablet next year and use K550i as router as I do with my laptop. With Nokia 810 and K550i, you don't need no iPhone. The combo will do everything I need (including Skype video calls ;) The phone is very stylish and light - I am very happy with it after 6 months and I highly recommend it to anyone. I hope this proves useful.Regards

 review/text: Nice Phone. I bought it unlocked to use with cingular (now AT&T;). used sonyericssons for a while now, starting with t68i, t610, t637, w600i, w810i & now k550i. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the reception if slightly less compared to, say w810i. In office where I'd always get 5 bars, now I get 4 bars. But that doesn't bother me much.There was a continuing problem with the "4" key not working sometimes but that seems to have been resolved by sonyerisson via their new firmware update. Make sure you update the phone, either over the air or by connecting to a computer. It upgrades JAVA, the camera software version & this annoying "4" issue.Overall I like this phone & hope that SE will move towards making all their phones 14mm slim. On a similar note don't forget to check out W580i as well if you are looking at this phone.

 review/summary: Great phone, good battery, nice interface
 review/text: I am really happy w/ this phone. Had it for about 6 months now and like almost everything about it. Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place. A really excellent camera for a phone in this price range. I have a couple complaints about button location and the light/flash on the camera.Pros: Small, easy to use, practical menus, great camera (2MP, and it beats the pants off my wife's Nokia which also has a 2MP), good battery life and great screenCons: Light/flash for the camera is horrible. Its too bright to be a light and doesn't really function as a flash. Still, great for finding your lost keys. The buttons in the middle on the side are in a very popular position so if you don't have your phone locked, you are bound to hit these accidentally.Overall great phone and would buy it again.

 review/summary: Great phone
 review/text: I got this phone to replace my k750i which was kind of bulky, the new k550i is slimmer and it has a bigger screen, and it looks stylish.This is what I think of the phone:Photos are great, I mean compared to other phones.The dial keys are different compared to the k750i, with this new style of keys it gets almost impossible to type with a skin cover on it (unles you press them with yout finger nail), a clear crystal skin will work better. I usually press the Internet button accidentally, which bothers me most of the times and I need to cancel the internet as fast as I notice that it is accessing to the service, they may have put that function in another place.If you use it to play Music, you might use the free hands because the integrated speaker is not as good as the one included in the Walkman version, remember that this is the Cybershoot version. But any way it works so so. (Some times when forwarding songs to look for what I want to listen, it gets stuck as it couldn't find the mp3 file in to the memory, so I need to restart it, and it works again all Ok. this may be a failure or sony might know).I got a 1gb memory and a skin for my k550i.(updated)I may get a 2Gb memory later. (which is supported)(updated : 03/07/08)A week a go my cellphone signal died, I had to open it and made a "mexicanada" (a Mexican hack LOL), so I put a thin wire in to the antenna plug that it's at the bottom and passing it through the battery compartment near to the corner of it, I got the wire to the top of the phone under the cover that it's neat to the camera. So you won't notice that anything has happened to it.So now I get signal almost everywhere without drooping calls.

 review/summary: Worked, but had a hardware problem later.
 review/text: I got this charger in August 2007. I plugged my player into it every time I used it in the car. Between late January 2008 and early August 2008 it wasn't being used because it was not in my possession (or anybody else's). Then in late February 2009 I noticed that it wouldn't plug in anymore. When I examined the mini-USB end, I saw that a little piece inside was sunken in and caused the metal inlet to be pushed inside the rubber body when plugging it into the player. I tried to use tweezers to pull up the metal form inside, but it was no use. I threw out the charger and am buying another one to see if it happens again. I think this time though, I will only plug in my player for trips longer than 15 minutes. It took about a year altogether for this problem to occur, with daily plugging and unplugging.

 review/summary: Cell Charger
review/text: We upgraded phones and I needed a charger for my car so I orderd one for my car and at the price Amazon had it for what a deal. Also, it shipped very quickly. Then my husband borrowed mine and I had to order another for him. So we have two of them and they both work very well and we are pleased with their performance. These are fast chargers and they work very well. I had heard,however, that fast chargers are not good for cell batteries. That they can wear out your batteries faster but was not sure so if you have any doubts ask your phone dealer or battery provider.

review/summary: Great Charger at a Great Price
 review/text: My phone seemed to only lose it's charge when I happened to be in my car. I thought my provider was going to supply me with a mobile charger but nope just the standard home A/C model. I searched for a mobile charger directly from Nokia and couldn't believe the price they wanted for it! I figured I would just make do without one. That was until I found this one. I have had no problems with it what so ever. I don't see how you possibly could. Just simple quick recharging power on the go.

 review/summary: Works Okay But Cheap Rubber Cord Doesn't Last Long!
 review/text: I got this when I got a Nokia 6600 years back and while the Nokia 6600 lasted very well and I really liked it and I only had to replace it when the on/off button got spoiled after 5 years I found that I had little use for the car charger as I also had a spare battery with me and so it turned out to be an impulse buy with little use for me. However, it does work okay and if you are the kind who spends hours in your car then this may be very useful should your battery dies when you need it the most. Another thing I found about this charger is the rubber/plastic covering the wire is cheap and started to turn white and then flake off after a while making it useless after that. I guess you get what you pay for and for the price advertised one shouldn't expect too much quality although the Nokia name has been tarnished a little for having itself associated with such a cheaply produced item.

 review/summary: Name brand no problems, yea right!
 review/text: I researched several different types that would work on my older Nokia phone and found this one that had pretty good reviews overall. It also costs a little more being actually made by Nokia for a Nokia phone. I'm thinking where could I go wrong. Not! The only reason I gave 3 stars and a somewhat bad review is because when plugging it in to any car cigarette lighter for recharging, I usually have to twist it or rotate it a little bit to get it to make contact and for it to start charging the phone. Why I don't know other than the contact area is not big enough on the charger plugin. I had an older nonbrand one which only cost me 4 or 5 dollars that worked perfect for about 4 years until the plastic housing broke. Unfortunately I could not find it anymore.

 review/summary: Cord is a bit too short.
review/text: While this is really just a simple cell phone charger- I must say-the cord is just too short to be useful while using the phone. I own an SUV, the cigarette lighter is rather low to the floor - I suppose my complaint should be with the car manufacturer. The cord makes it uncomfortable because its just a bit too short, I can only use this cord while speaking on my right. However, this OEM cord is much better than others I had bought before it.

 review/text: I'm in the middle of my pregnancy, so I really need a car charger!Amazon's description said this model was compatible with my NOKIA6102 flip cell phone, but it isn't it has the standard regular size tip for charging, which would work with most NOKIA cell phones prior to the NOKIA 6102 flip phone! The NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone has a new smaller charger end, so with all due respect might I suggest that someone grab a NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone, and the above car charger to see that they are "NOT" compatible, to help prevent this in the future! Because I am still pregnant and I still need a car charger, for my NOKIA 6102 cell phone!I due honestly appreciate the fact that Amazon at least paid for the return shipping, since the charger wasn't compatible!

 review/summary: Nokia Car Charger for Nokia Phones
review/text: The Nokia Charger works great compared to many chargers I have used before. I previously had an analouge Motorola phone and had one of those chargers that plugged into an outlet in your house and would take all night to charge for a usage of under 8 hours. It became a real pain. So I went out and bought a Nokia 5120i and bought this charger. My phone didn't lose power for days, but when it did, I plugged in the charger and it started the job. When you plug the large end into the cigarette charger in your car, there is a little light that comes on to let you know that there is power going through the charger. Than you plug the small end into a hole in the phone. If your phone is on, you will recieve a message saying &quot;Charger Connected&quot; and than another message 5 seconds later saying &quot;Charging.&quot; Then the charger starts the job. If your phone is down to the last quarter of energy, it will take approx. 30 minutes to charge full. THATS FAST. If you have 3/4 of the energy it will take about 2-10 minutes to charge full. And the battery will continue to last for a long time. Just keep charging whenever energy is lost. I have had this phone and charger for over one year and have had no problems. One complaint of many people is that the cord is too short. Well for me its not. I have a Chrysler Concorde and the phone reaches fine. The cord will stretch between 1 to 2 1/2 feet. So that should answer your question. If you have any other questions, I recommend that you contact Nokia.

 review/summary: A very good and reliable charger
 review/text: I bought this charger primarily for road trips. It takes me about 1 1/2 hour to charge my phone, and hence you might not need it that much if all you do is commute. It does however add the advantage of unlimited talk time in your car, whenever you do need it.The charger has a very solid feel, and it appears to be very good craftsmanship. It has proven to be very durable. I've owned and frequently used this charger for more than 2 1/2 years now, and I've never had anything go wrong with it. In my opinion, it works better than you could expect after that long of a time. It's been kept in my car permanently since I bought it, and by that has been exposed to excessive Arizona heat for weeks on end. With the desert heat comes the cooldown at night, so the temperature difference it's been exposed to has also been great. The charger has a convenient, little light to show you when it's charging.The charger's cord is a "feisty" one, so don't expect it to be too cooperative if you try to stretch it very far.All in all a charger you should expect to charge your Nokia phones (no surprises there?) for a long, long time, no matter what you put it through. The charger is very reliable and durable, and I highly recommend it. 5 STARS!!!

 review/summary: Don't skimp on charger
 review/text: I've had a Nokia 6185 phone for over 3 years. In that time I've owned 4 car chargers. I was sucked into the ... allure of the 10-12 dollar ones sold at the big mass merchant stores. These things are junk. Don't reliably charge the phone and are flimsy and break all the time. After getting one that wouldn't charge out of the box and returning it for one that would charge once in a while (and finally died after a couple months) I recieve a new Nokia one with my latest phone (Nokia 3285). What a difference. Works like a charm, is sturdy, and did I mention it's sturdy!!! Wish the cord was a bit longer but other than that it's great.

 review/summary: Great Charger
 review/text: I got my Nokia 252 last month and needed a charger for the car. I had a hard time finding a reasonably priced one until I found this one. It works great ! The only complaint I have is that the cord is not very long - but since I live in New York State and it is illegal to talk and drive at the same time - I have to pull over to talk - so the inconvenience of the short cord is miniscule.

 review/text: This charger helps you charge your battery on the go! No time to stick around the house and wait for the other charger to work and your spare battery is at the office. This gives me added piece of mind when i travel because i know my phone will always be there for me when i need it if i get stuck on side of road! everyone needs a car adapter... that is unless you don't have a car!

If it still isn't, check the fuse of your 12V outlet, as mine had been blown by the previous car owner!

 review/text: i ordered a car charger for a particular Nokia phone, because i left the charger overseas. Was suprised at the VERY low price, but the shipping and handling is where these people make their money. So when the info on their site was bad, the charger did not work and guess who carries the bag? A charger for 2 bucks and a 8 buck shipping, now if i pay $5 more i can send it back and maybe end up with the right charger, MAYBE. All this taking weeks to accomplish. Does your time have any value???? Don't order from them if it does.

 review/summary: good replacement
 review/text: I bought this charger to replace both my original Nokia cellphone charger and another replacement charger from Monster Cable. This charger is much better than what I had before. It is very sturdy and the wires do not pull out of the base as in my original charger. Also the connection between the charger and my cellphone is good and I don't have to worry about it not charging whenever I move my phone around. It charges up my phone pretty fast, and unlike the Monster Cable charger (which charged fast but caused the battery to drain faster), the battery holds its charge pretty well. I think this is a reliable charger and I'm happy with it.

It charges the phone and lets you use the phone while being charged. It has a long cord and generally is the perfect automobile compliment to your Nokia phone.

 review/summary: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
 review/text: The Good: This car charger is sturdy and very reliable. It doesn't have the flimsy feel of other car adapters I have used for other devices (CD player adapter is particularly on-the-cheap). The coil has stayed in great shape, which makes it easier to roll and store in a hurry.The Bad: The cord is just a *little* bit shorter than ideal. So, the phone can rest on the cupholder right next to the cigarette lighter, but it can't rest comfortably on the passenger seat. (It'll be right on the edge). Other adapters I've used (like for my CD player) work out a little better.The Ugly: Nothing ugly about it. It works fine, looks fine. A little green light glows to tell you it's getting power.In short: a handy little tool that does the job. Just a little disappointed in the length of the cable, but very happy with its sturdiness.

 review/text: The little black tip on the end of the charger snapped off inside my 8260 leaving it unable to be charged with either the car charger or the wall charger. The ATT store couldn't extract the piece and told me this was common for this charger and phone after 1 1/2 yrs. More of a hassle than I'd expect. Sure, it worked fast but I'm bothered by what seems planned obsolescence by the manufacturers at Nokia. I don't like having to get a new phone or accessories every couple of years. Thumbs down on the durability.

review/text: I have purchased the car battery charger for my MicroTAC 650 phone, and I love it! It charges the battery so fast! Your battery can be completely dead, and as soon as you plug your phone into the car adapter with this charger, you can make and receive calls from your phone. It doesn't take long at all until you have a fully charged battery, ready to use anywhere. Incidentally, my MicroTAC 650 is an analog phone, but I would recommend it over any of the new digital phones. I switched to a digital phone last year because they were supposed to be better, but I switched back to an old reliable MicroTAC 650.

I have not been tough on them at all, they simply stop charging, the light won't go on, or they simply won't work. I realize that there aren't many options, as Samsung has been clever enough to design a very unique plug and it is unlikely that other manufacturers will emerge, but it is a shame that this product is not as durable as the phones that it supports.

 review/text: Used many different adapters over the years. This one is the most durable and adaptive. The connection to the bottom of the phone STAYS (where most do not) and the connnector has not come apart where others have. After reading another review on this product, one of the stronger features of this adapter is the built in spare fuse. Sometimes car voltages spike, thus blowing the adapter fuse. This one has another built in to replace it if necessary. This adapter also charges faster than others I have used. I am pleased. I also am partial to the manufacturers own equipment. Although they are less expensive, I am very reluctant, actually will not use off brand stuff. Motorola had the best adapter in their older phones. This one now replaces it as the best.

 review/summary: Don't waste your money!
 review/text: The prime selling feature of the Jabra line of headsets is the &quot;earbud,&quot; a soft rubber cap that is anatomically designed to fit in the ear. The problem is, the earbuds don't stay on the units securely, so once they fall off, you're stuck with a headset that doesn't stay in your ear and you've just wasted your money. I lost my earbud the first day I used the headset. Why? Because the soft rubber earbud easily snags onto pocket linings, collars ... everything ... and when it does, it pulls loose from the headset and falls *silently* onto the floor. I replaced the earbud and tried securing it with Elmer's glue, and then later, rubber cement. Nothing works. The only way to positively not lose the headset is to leave it in your ear from the moment you wake in the morning till you go to bed at night --- not very practical! Skip this product and save yourself some money and aggravation.

The dark undertones keep the phone looking new and clean unlike some of the lighter or laquer looking finishes that show every smudge and fingerprint. I often recieve compliments on the phone when among company. If you're looking for a fun change or different look but don't want to lock your phone into a novelty or bubble-gum look, the earth theme is a perfect choice!

 review/text: I've been wanting to get this for about a year. None of the phone stores seem to have it in stock, probably due to the fact that the deep, metallic green color looks like gray or black from a ways off. I'm EXTREMELY happy with this color because, though it's not too flashy, it's got class &amp; style. The deep green comes alive in the sunlight, and in my opinion is the coolest color out there! This faceplate is also made by Nokia, so it's not a cheap after market product, like a lot of them out there. Try it for yourself...

Also sync this phone to a PC is challenging, you need to install the software several times to get it to work. If you just want to use it as a phone it is a great phone but all the extras don't work unless you buy a Verizon phone.

 review/summary: No problems, love it
 review/text: I have Tmobile and I bought the unlocked phone and just traded sim cards from my old phone. I did lose some of my newer contacts and some archived text messages, but other that that everything has been fine. Synching to my PC was flawless. Could be a bit tough for a novice but transfering MP3's is easy. The keys are VERY touchy, that took getting used to. There are a lot of things I'm annoyed about but I chalk it up to not being used to the phone yet. So far it has worked well and I'm happy. It takes some patience to figure out, but it's a great phone IMO. My main concern is it's size, I bought a case for it because I'm afraid at the price I'll damage it. I paid $170 on ebay.So I've been using this phone for a while now. I still like it. I keep it in my pocket while at work, use it as an alarm clock etc. The quality of the pictures it takes isn't as good as it could be, especially indoors. Outdoor shots are much sharper quality with the natural light. The MP3 player works well but for the price of the phone I'm feeling like it should have more memory. In any case, I still rate it high after all this time. I haven't had problems.

 review/summary: Disappointing transaction
 review/text: The item was fine. However, it would not work on my wireless network (not at all clear from the description), so I had to return it. I was promised credit minus a 10% restocking fee IF AND ONLY IF I wrote a review favorable to the seller, which I did. To date (February 8, 2008) my card has not been credited. I have never had a bad transaction through Amazon until this one, but I would not recommend that anyone do business with this ethically challenged seller.

 review/summary: not good in US
 review/text: I have had this phone in NYC area for about 3 months now. My wife hasCingular (RAZR) and I was going to get that phone as well, but thensaw this one available at the Cingular store and figured I would get it for the looks, andCingular said they support the phone so I thought all would be good.After using it for 3 months, I lose service in A LOT of areas aroundhere, and my wife's phone works fine. I guess it is b/c of all this1900, 850, 900 band issues. If I knew aboutthis problem before purchasing the phone with a 2 year contract, Iwould definitely have gotten a different model instead. Also, I justwent on a trip up to northern Vermont, and my wife's phone neverdropped a call or lost service (Cingular), and I had no service for the wholetrip (Cingular), which was very frustrating trying to do business from the road.I was thinking of getting the battery signal increaser metal strip,but after reading more about the phone, I do not think they will help any?? Ifanyone has any suggestions for me to get a better signal, I wouldappreciate it, as I have paid a lot for this phone that loses a lotof calls daily.

 review/summary: Upsetting Disappointments
 review/text: I bought this phone last year on Amazon. I liked the sleek design, the color and I was very attracted to the touchscreen. The phone works quite well, talk time is good and standby time is great. I had no problems with syncing it to my computer. The bluetooth works well too. The phone can take some good banging as this has dropped from me several times with the battery flying out, and it still works fine. The one and only con I would give it (which is a major one) is that there is no other option for navigating around the menu in the phone except for the touchscreen. Some other phones have a touchscreen, but still have buttons that you can press to get in the menu and work the phone. This one only has the touchscreen, so if that screen goes bad...you can forget even having a phone because you won't be able to make a call, send a text, play a game, change your phone settings....nothing that you can usually do while navigating around in the menu. This is the problem that I am having right now. I sadly dropped the phone in a puddle of water a while back. The phone still works fine, functional-wise, but the touchscreen has freezed and no longer works, so I can't do anything with the phone. This is the major problem as I think that they should have also put in some buttons so that you can still get in your menu. Now, I have to look for another phone to buy. I like LG products so I will stick with this brand, I will just make sure to buy a phone with menu, select and navigation buttons.

 review/summary: Cool blue!
 review/text: This is not silver as we think of it (maybe that would be the faceplate in Shark Silver). This is a pale, pearlescent blue that will keep me happy with my current phone for a while longer. Now I want a car this color, too. The lens of my original black 5160 faceplate was cracked. This is a beautiful solution. This faceplate does not come with its own key pad. If you need one of those also, read through faceplate descriptions carefully. Some come with key pad, some don't. I've only had this for 2 days and it hasn't fallen out of my bag yet, so I can't say how it would withstand that sort of abuse. I bet the lens is not any less shatter-proof than the original.

 review/text: I like my phone to look different and ring different from other phones. This Bermuda Blue is a very nice color, and actually has a range of colors in it, the plastic underneath is almost purple. It's my favorite color. I've just recently got my second 5100-series phone now, and I've had this faceplate both times. The first one held up well, considering phones tend to take a lot of abuse from me. A few dings did not detract from the look of this product.

 review/summary: Nice faceplate that adds style
 review/text: I bought this faceplate from another store for use with my Nokia 6160. It looks really nice and it's one of the 'chameleon' faceplates - they change color depending on the light. It'll either be a nice shade of green or an amber color. I haven't seen many people with the 'chameleon' faceplate and that just makes it look even nicer. I've never seen this type of faceplate before and once I put it on, it looked really nice. The nice thing about getting an OEM (Original Accesory) is that it fits perfectly.This faceplate is definately worth it, I've tried many generic types and they just don't fit my phone. Now that I'm using a Nokia brand faceplate, it fits perfectly!

 review/summary: Works well so far
 review/text: Since I bought my first cell phone (Motorola StarTac), I've always clipped my phone to my belt and never really liked the leather skin look as it covers the phone. When I bought the Nokia 6133 and the rep. told me they didn't make a swivel holster, I seriously considered buying a different phone. I ordered this aftermarket holster hoping it would live up to the standards I am used to and so far, I am pleased with the product.One thing that was not immediately apparent, was which way the phone goes into the holster. On my Nextel i730 and i860 phones, the external display went to the inside. With this holster, the external display faces out. Although this should not be an issue for me, for some who might have a chance of bumping into things, this could lead to scratching on the outside. One convenience of this is that the holster actually clips to the base part of the phone, so you can use every function of the phone with it still in the holster. You can flip it open, take pictures, use speakerphone, etc.Pulling the phone out of the holster was a little different than my others as well. This holster has the release on the side. Since I have it on my left side, I use my index or middle finger to release it and use my thumb to push it out of the holster. It snaps back in pretty easily, but be sure it snaps on both sides or it could fall out.I've only had it for a few days, but I hope it continues to please as it has so far.

 review/summary: Beautiful, but does have design flaws.
 review/text: This case is beautifully crafted and very well made. But it does definitely have some serious design flaws. The opening to access the charging port is on the WRONG SIDE OF THE PHONE. So you have to remove the case to recharge the phone. Also, the flap that goes over the flip portion of the phone obsures the camera lens (But don't they all?) and is so tight that it holds the flip constantly open. Within an hour of receiving this item, I had cut off the flip cover with a pair of scissors. Hated doing that, but the last two complaints were then fully eliminated immediately. The strap that covers the key pad still holds the phone in the case securely. And, actually, I think it even looks better without the beauty of the phone being obscured by the case flap.

 review/summary: It's OK, but not a great fit
 review/text: It was cheap enough not to worry about it, and it's probably time I get an iPhone 4 to replace this original iPhone, but the case itself just doesn't fit as well as I was hoping. The Home button is hard to press, the bottom row of the keyboard is difficult to get to because of the case, and the silence switch requires the pointiest of fingers to change - all because the case is cumbersome and doesn't fit perfectly.I was hoping for better.

 review/summary: Cheap-o
 review/text: Classic case (get it? case? har har) of 'you get what you pay for'.Dint expect much from this guy for the price, but figured it better than no case at all. I was pretty much on the money with that prediction. Not much protection from this guy. If youre looking for something rough and tough that will keep your phone alive and well for years to come, this is not your case.The case is thin and flimsy. Kind of scary to put on, and my fears were rewarded when the case finally tore trying to put the thing on for the 20th or so time (doesnt fit in an iPod cradle with the case on)My advice is to skip this case entirely and get a real case if you want one. This thing is like wrapping tape around your phone (until it tears and becomes entirely useless)

 review/summary: Sadly, disappointed....
 review/text: I think Burton is onto something excellent here..... however, it'll probably be another year or two before its technology is perfectedFirst off - the jacket is excellent! Very flexible, warm, and waterproof --- so no complaints on the jacketIt is the technology that disappoints meThe jacket has a neat construction --- you keep your iPod on one side of your chest and your phone on the other side, with a remote on your wrist that pretty much controls both devicesThe phone functions are neat because calls come through immediately, with the speakers in the hoodie allowing you to hear the other person calling and a mic in the front part allowing you to talk ---- the entire setup is pretty convenient and pretty solid, as people could hear me well and I could hear themHowever, the speaker could be better..... calls and music come through clear, but I wish it were much louderThe iPod functions are what really upset me though -- the iPod is slow to respond to the wrist controls functions.... in addition, sometimes the iPod functions won't work if you have the phone connected on bluetoothoverall -- the stability of the jacket's system needs to be worked out --- I'm pretty impressed with it, but wait another year for Burton to fix this onePEACE AND LOVE AND HAPPY BUYING!!!!!!Muhammad Ali Hasan

To make sure your plug in works, look at the back of it and make sure it says ACP-7U or ACP-9U.

 review/summary: A nice accessory, but lacks adequate documentation.
 review/text: The dual slot charger is a good idea if you need to keep a hot second battery. I use mine with a StarTAC ST7867 and an extra Lithium Ion extra capacity main battery. The documentation that Motorola provides consists of a single sheet sectioned into 15 1.5&quot; x 2&quot; rectangles printed front and back in 27 different languages (this is not an exaggeration). Something that is not made clear is that there are two spring-loaded black plastic tensioners in the spare battery slot. Since they are not readily discernable, if you are not aware of them it will seem as if the extra capacity main battery will not fit into the slot. It takes some jockeying, but the plastic tensioners move toward the phone charger slot to make room for the spare battery, which is inserted contacts down and facing toward the power supply connector. After the battery is inserted, the tensioners keep pressure on the battery so that the battery contacts are held firmly against the charger contacts.

 review/summary: Phone is ACTIVE while charging
 review/text: I disagree w/ a previous review. I have had no problems RECEIVING calls and simultaneously charging the phone using this desktop charger. In fact, if you have the phone set to vibrate, it rings in the charger anyway...However, unlike the regular charger, you can't talk and charge at the same time. (It would be pretty funny trying to hold a desktop charger to your face to talk anyway.) So whenver the phone rings, just pull the phone out and talk!Note 1: There is no &quot;release button&quot; you need to push to disconnect the phone. So it's easy to grab the phone in a hurry...Note 2: Charging an additional battery is really weird. Just like a previous review, it is spring loaded, and you need to load it at an angle. I too looked all over the 1 pg. manual w/o luck to try and figure this out...

 review/summary: Beware - not much here
 review/text: Never assume. What you get is pretty much just what you see in the picture. There is no cord to plug this unit in. You must still use the charging cord that came with the phone to connect it to an AC outlet. As such, this cannot be used as a second charger. The only advantage is the ability to charge an extra battery along with the phone. Once you know this, it is apparent from the description, but I guess I didn't read closely enough and assumed too much. All other comments accurate.

 review/summary: Don't buy it
review/text: This item has few redeeming features, and lots of problems. First, it is extremely cheaply constructed with very thin plastic. It probably would not survive a fall from a table onto a hard floor. Second, you can't really use it as a spare charger, since it does not come with its own cord. You have to use the one that came with your phone or fork out the extra bucks for a spare cord. Third, the battery is held in place by a flimsy spring mechanism. It's hard to get the battery seated properly, and if you bump the charger even slightly, it dislodges from the electrical contacts. Fourth, it was apparently only designed to charge standard-size batteries. It does not accomodate the auxilliary-size Motorola batteries. Fifth, the documentation is almost non-existent. For the cost, I expected something with better construction and design. Dont' buy this one; here are higher quality 3rd party chargers out there that are cheaper.

 review/summary: no docs, item delivered different than pictured
 review/text: The charger I got from Amazon.com came without a single word of documentation. The manual for my phone helps a little. The charger comes with snap-in templates to fit different phones (I guess), but not a word of explanation about which one to use, or what the others might be for. Maddening. I just played Garanimals(tm) until I had a good fit, but why was that up to me to figure out? At these prices, write some instructions!The item that I received is different from both the one in the manual and the one pictured on Amazon.com even as I write this review, so any docs about what the lights mean would be useless anyway.Kudos to the guy who figured out that there's a status light for data sync activity -- go to the head of the class! :-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine. The &quot;drop in&quot; slot for the phone is more like &quot;pin the tail on the donkey&quot;, though, same as with my Nextel phone. All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.

Each time Motorolla customer service was very nice about replacing it however the rear pocket for charging batteries has never worked. I've tested it with three batteries - 2 Li ION and 1 NiMH and it doesn't work with any in the rear pocket. It acts like its charging the battery but does not. The front pocket does a fine job of holding the phone and I haven't had trouble with the back holding the battery. If it worked it would be worth owning.

 review/text: I use about 2000 mins/month talk time and leave my phone on 24 hrs/day. Some of this time I am in an analog roaming area, which tends to eat up the battery in standby (and certainly while talking). However, generally I can go all day without charging the battery. This Slim Extra Capacity battery came with my Timeport 8097 (I think Motorola is including this with all phones now) and I estimate it gives about 2hr talktime &amp; maybe 3-4 day standby on a digital signal. Probably about a 60 min talktime and 14hr standby on analog. Charge the phone whenever convenient (i.e., while driving or overnight) and you can't go wrong. Buy an extra one just in case your original wears out on you.

 review/text: An exact copy of the extra cap battery I bought with my timeport two years ago. Hold a good charge and does what you want.My last battery is still pretty good (about 65% of what the new battery does) and I use it very often. I expect the same of this one.

 review/summary: Miserable piece of trash
 review/text: You can see why they have fancy colour earpieces for this thing - they have to find something to appeal to you about it.I turned it in every conceivable orientation and never found a good fit to my ear. (In case you ask, I would describe my ears as &quot;average&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;). A diagram on the packaging would have saved much frustration on that score.But NOTHING will compensate for the fact that the built-in microphone function is utterly useless. I thought maybe it was just me - but two friends also got suckered into buying one of these, and their cellphone calls went from reasonable to completely unintelligible.Do not, repeat NOT, buy this product.

 review/summary: incorrect listing in amazon
 review/text: Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Nokia 918 model phone. This is incorrect since the phone does not have a 2.5 mm plug for the earjack. Obviously, if you have a different model phone, that may not be the case.

 review/summary: Interesting technology, but not entirely practical
 review/text: I've been using the Jabra Universal EarSet for the last week with a Motorola Talkabout phone. The incoming call quality is very clear, but background noise will play a tremendous part in how well your voice is picked up. You'll sound very clear in a quiet environment-your home, office, suburbs, etc. With a television on, things can get muddled. Outdoors in a city during rush hour is terrible, requiring you to cup your ear to give your voice any kind of quality.Technology-wise, it's impressive how well the EarSet works, but for urbanites on the go, there are better products out there.

 review/summary: Extremely Comfortable, but poor sound quality
review/text: I have a Plantronics M175 handsfree unit and the sound quality on it was just incredible. It even has a mute function, which is handy when on conference calls. Still, it is an over the ear type device, thus at times, it just doesn't feel comfortable, though it seems to stay on my ear just fine. The need for comfort prompted me to buy the Jabra. The comfort on the Jabra is outstanding. The comfort alone kept me happy for a couple of weeks, but eventually, I went back to my Plantronics M175. The reason,.... sound quality! The Jabra tends to have a tunnel, echo like sound, especially when in the car during rush hour, (a time when you need the hands free unit most). The inability to even listen to some of my voice mails with the Jabra device at times prompted me to try the Plantronics M175 once again. The Plantronics device is crystal clear. I wish it was as comfortable as the Jabra, but when I break it down, I need to hear and understand first on my phone, comfort is secondary.

review/summary: Clever simple design that works
 review/text: I had seen several people using this and thought it was a great design. They gave it excellent reviews so I took the plunge.I was under the impression that the ear piece picked up your voice from your ear canal so that your speeach would be crystal clear to the person on the other end. However, this isnt the case. The mic is in the piece that sticks out of your ear. This is only a problem in loud environments where the mic tends to pick up a lot of background noise. I drive a sports car that has a relativly loud cockpit and tend to get complaints from the people I speak to. When I drive the wife's sedan its no problem at all.As for quality, it is very well put together and I haven't had any issues. The brightly colored silicone ear pieces let you select from small, medium and large for both right and left ears. I leave mine in the car a lot and the colors started to fade and popped off of the earphone more easily. The rubber ear piece can be easy to loose.Sound quality is very good as long as the rubber piece is correctly seated on the earphone. It also has to be placed in your ear correctly or the sound is a bit muffled.I had tried other over the ear boom mics and those &quot;bug on a wire&quot; style. They all present compromises on quality and clarity. This has been the best trade off I have tried.Overall a high quality hands-free that looks cool to.

 review/summary: Better than the rest
 review/text: Ive had this product for over a year with no problems. i tried the ones with the boom mikes which were more problems than any thing else and normaly i ended up hitting the mike with my hand.. also wearing sunglasses was discomforting as well.. With the jabra i noted no background noise while using the unit with the windows up and air on which is what you would want to do any way while carrying on a conversation in the car. as far as the body noise goes that problem can be solved easily however since the mike is part of the ear piece the person you are speaking to will hear all that you do this includes gritting teeth and chewing on m&amp;m's while you talk over all though there is no better unit currently on the market that is as convenient..

 review/summary: Microphone ruins this product
 review/text: The earpiece may fit comfortably and even sound pretty good, however the microphone is not aceptable. I find that I have to speak way too loudly in order for the other person to hear what I am trying to say. Either I talk so loud that everyone around me hears my conversation or the person I'm calling can't hear me well enough. This is not an item I would recommend to anyone unless you really want to annoy anyone within 10 feet of you.

 review/summary: Mic NOT in the cord
 review/text: This was my very first earpiece purchase before bluetooth phones/earpieces were financially available to me. LOL I loved this earpiece and its price so much that I bought like 3 of them! I ended up selling one of them to a friend (but only because she begged me) and keeping the other two for myself. I managed to break one of them and was grateful that I had the extra one to fall back on immediately because it was no longer for sale here. Once BT earpieces were available to me with a external adapter, I graduated from this unit. I have nothing bad to say about this unit & probably still have it in a box somewhere. I bought it simply because the microphone wasn't annoyingly located in the cord and it fit securely and comfortably in your ear. I recommended it to others.

 review/summary: Comfortable and holds up better than competition
review/text: I bought a Jabra earset for my Nokia 6160 a year ago and it is still working great. Everyone tells me that my voice sounds normal and many times people are surprised to find out that I am on a cell phone. If you have a cell phone and you talk while driving, an ear set is a must. This is the best one I have found. It is comfortable in your ear and the thicker/tougher wire seems to hold up better. I had a Nokia brand ear set and it developed a short after only a few months, which is why I was searching for a better set to begin with. The package comes with various sizes of gel ear pieces for both right and left ears. The only problem I have had is that I was a little rough on it and the piece that connects to the phone doesn't hang on as well as it used to. But I called the manufacturer and they gave me a warrenty return code and promised me a new one even though I didn't have the receipt or any proof of when it was purchased. Conclusion: It's a good buy. I am getting ready to buy one for my wife.

 review/text: I tried several of the other headsets and ear pieces for cellular phones. Many I returned to the (large chain, small shop) stores. I had some previous experience with JABRA EarSets from using them with voice recognitions systems. I found one for my Nokia phone and one for my Motorola phone (which also works in my home phone 2.5mm jack). I love them. People never complain about the sound quality and almost never know that I'm wearing it. It stays firmly in your ear. It is comfortable long term. I recommend it to everyone who asks.

 review/summary: works well under right conditions
 review/text: The earphone (hearing) worked well. I see several reviews that talked about poor fit. You have to work to get this thing seated correctly. It IS uncomfortable if you seat it incorrectly or use the wrong size earpiece. The microphone also works poorly if it doesn't seat solidly in your ear. I suspect some people don't follow directions (insert, then twist and make sure that the top part of earpiece is OUTSIDE your ear structure). The microphone is very sensitive and picks up your voice well (if seated correctly) but it also picks up noise very well. I drive a mini-van that has fair amount of road noise on highway. I returned mine to try the Jabra mini-boom model. Same good fit and sound, but the microphone picks up less noise. I'm happier with the mini-boom. A bonus is that it is half the cost of the earset model.

 review/text: I bought the Jabra set to use with my Nokia 5160 phone. As far as I could tell, the sound quality was acceptable, but there are two things to keep in mind:1) The plastic ear inserts not only would not fit comfortably in my ear (one hurt because it was too big, the next size down wouldn't stay in my ear). Further, the plastic inserts kept falling off the speaker!2) There are no helpful instructions to help you figure out which of the inserts are for the right and which for the left ear. You have to experiment. There isn't even instruction on how to insert them in your ear properly.

 review/summary: Decent Overall, Problem with background noise
 review/text: I bought the Jabra Earset for my Nokia 5190 about a month ago. A friend of mine also bought the same earset and I was able to hear them talking on theirs (using Nokia 6190). The receiver sound quality (talking) is slightly worse than a normal cellphone. It sounds somewhat distant and echoey. Also, it picks up background noise, especially from a car and almost seems to amplify the noise, making it hard for people to hear you. The speaker (listening) for the user is very clear and I had no problems finding an earpiece adapter that fit me.PROBLEM: The biggest problem I've noted with these earsets is an annoying background &quot;buzz&quot;. I have been told that this is caused by the earpiece wire picking up reception from the cellphone antenna. This buzz can be heard both on your side and the person you are talking to can hear it as well, creating quite an annoyance. In fact, this background buzz is so bad at times that I have stopped using my Jabra earset entirely unless I am driving (It is law in California). The only way to get rid of the buzz is to orient the wire in certain positions or hold the wire in certain places (very impractical, especially if you are moving around). I would return this item and buy something else except that I bought it using an Amazon discount certificate, so I can't. I've been told that not all earsets have this problem so it is probably advisable that you if you get this you are able to return it or try it out first.

Major disappointment. Maybe it works for some people but not for me.

 review/text: And comfortable too. I like it so much that I don't want to use the phone without my Jabra, even when I am not in the car. I tried several other headsets, but the Jabra EarSet was the only one I tried that sounds loud enough to hear when I am driving. And, everyone I call from the road says that I sound very clear. The EarGel can come off easily, especially when I toss it on the seat and throw a bunch of junk on top of it, so now I keep it in my center console.

 review/summary: Horrid
 review/text: It did not work. The different colored ear pieces were very hard to remove, and when they were on it was increadably hard to hear the other person. Not to mention, none of the ear pieces fit my ear properly, so they fell out easily or I was never able to get them inside my ear. This was a poor buy on my part.

 review/summary: Large, Clumsy and Perfect
 review/text: This battery is what is, a bigger more powerful battery that adds some bulk to the otherwise slim 8500. I have purchased two of these products and could not be more pleased with them - they are good for about 5 - 7 days of standby time with casual use. I once managed 6 hours of talk time. They charge quickly and fit into the regular charging slot that comes with the phone. In a perfect world there would be unlimited battery time and no need for this product, but until then, this is a necessary accessory of the 8500 that does a great job.

 review/summary: Get this battery!
 review/text: I had the equivalent battery for my old Samsung 3500 and thought it was great. I was not disappointed with this one for the 8500. Standby life is close to a week and it lasts three days even with heavy usage. Unlike many extended-life batteries, it fits in the desktop charger; it was not an afterthought. If I have time, like overnight, I put the phone in the cradle, or I just swap it with the original battery for a day. It's a little bit bigger and heavier, but all of the cases and accessories still work with it. I just don't put it in my shirt pocket with the extended battery; it's a little heavy for that.

In order for the &quot;ear bud&quot; to remain in your ear, you must have truly large ears. If this is not bad enough, you practically have to eat the microphone in order for the person that you called to hear you clearly (and I am not known for talking softly).Try another product.

 review/summary: Tried the rest, this still the best.
 review/text: This is the 5th Samsung earbud I have bought. I lost two, and used one to make a homemade Handsfree with a small amplified speaker for my SCH 411. I have never had any problems with the earsets. I DID have problems with the earphone Jack on the phone wearing out. I thought it was a problem with the earphone, but it was the ear jack. I had to replace 2 phones because of that. That was no fault of the earbud. Now when it happened the last time, I went to Verizon to find they have discontinued this phone. Now I have the latest Qualcomm M510. The Samsung earbud also works perfect in this tiny phone with AGC. I have no problems with people hearing me. I will point out though: If the noise inside the car is loud, it effects the way you have to speak. Since the mike is noise cancelling, you have to talk louder than the noise...thats all. I am totally satisfied and at this price, I am buying two more.

 review/summary: Disappointing
 review/text: I should preface my review by saying I am new to Samsung phones and the only thing I care about is clarity of the incoming sound. I had been using the Nokia 5160 with the garden variety in-ear bud for 3 years with very happy results -- the incoming sound was comparable to having a landline phone receiver next to my ear. By contrast, the Samsung OEM bud used with ny new Samsung R225 phone is a disappointment. There is a huge difference in sound quality between holding the phone next to my ear versus listening through the earbud. The latter sounds as if I had water in my ears -- muffled, faint -- I can barely hear while I'm driving, which is 75% of the time that I use my phone, so this is a real problem. Will explore the (new?) Plantonics M205 option and hope it's better...

 review/text: I like my Samsung Ear Bud and use it all the time. I do find that I have to hold the microphone close to my mouth in order for people to hear me clearly. In the car (where no one sees me as I'm sure this looks foolish) I put the Ear Bud in my left ear and loop the wire over my right ear so that the microphone rests just under my lower lip. Then people can hear me just fine.Note that the button on the microphone doesn't just turn a Samsung phone on and off, it also activates the phone's &quot;Who would you like to call?&quot; feature.The first headset I tried was the Jabra EarSet. The Samsung Ear Bud works far better and costs less.

 review/summary: poor all around
 review/text: I have used this headset for about 4 months. It is adequate in the sense that you can hear on it, and people can hear you, but that's about it. My specific problems with this unit are 1) If the bud it not turned in your ear such that the speaker points directly down your ear canal, the volume of the caller is much reduced. I wound up driving around holding the unit pointed into my ear just to get sufficient volume, thus defeating the &quot;hands-free&quot; aspect of the device. 2) Its hard exterior become painfully uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so of talking and I had to often switch ears mid-conversation. 3) People I talked to often complained about being able to hear me while driving, even with all windows up and the radio off. 4) after these four months, the speaker just died on me, and I'll have to buy another one!I will be trying the over-the-ear-with-a-boom-mic or the all-in-ear models next. Avoid this one if you can.

 review/summary: nice accessory for certain situations
 review/text: I recently bought this item when I noticed I couldn't answer certain urgent calls from my father while I was driving. I don't like to talk while I drive (for safety reasons) so I would call back whenever I got to out from my car.Now that I have this ear bud from Samsung, I can answer more urgent calls while I keep both hands and my eyes on driving. I don't use it too often but it serves its purpose.There are certain things that I like and don't like about it. People who I've called using the device say that it is sometimes hard to hear my voice even if I raise my voice. Other times, people can hear me very clearly. The clarity of the ear bud is good and makes it useful for longer conversations especially when the phone starts to get hot. The little button on the receiver accesses the voice-activated phone directory. It's a nice feature for those who may have that feature on their phone.All in all, the Samsung ear bud is a nice accessory for certain situations especially while driving although the microphone tends to get mixed results depending on the person listening on the other line.

 review/summary: Decent reliability; good voice quality; not noise-cancelling
 review/text: I've used this Samsung OEM headset with my Samsung phones (first the 3500 then the 8500) for three years now, and, after trying some Jabras and a Plantronics briefly, I've decided that the Samsung piece sounds most natural in my ears (relative to the quality of the audio heard through the phone's built-in speaker, for example). The Jabras sound better than generics but still not as natural as this one. The Plantronics are great as far as noise-cancellation (and pretty natural-sounding, if I recall correctly), but I haven't seen an in-the-ear model, or any style at all that comes with the button like this one does...The Talk/End/Voice activation button on the microphone bead is fantastic (for Samsung Phones).The microphone is, however, a bit weak, and, in order to speak at a normal volume, I find myself holding the bead up to my mouth, unless I happen to be in a good position relative to the mic.The piece will probably break within a year, but at a third of the price of the Jabra (plus not having to switch ear gels when switching ears), this is a no-brainer for Samsung-phone owners who use the voice activation and/or drive and want to be able to answer the phone without actually touching the unit.

 review/text: I like everything about the hands free operation, but I'm having to shop for another head set because the people I talk to complain that they can't hear me well enough. To talk to my mother, I even resorted to clipping the shirt clip up in my hair so the microphone would dangle in front of my mouth. Then, she could hear me OK. Unless you want to yell while talking on this head set, you'll probably be better off with a boom microphone style of hands free headset.

 review/text: Let's start with the bad things:1: There's no way this battery will ever give 2 weeks of standby time in the real world. When I first got it, about 7 months ago, it would give 5-6 days. Not bad, but a far cry from the "1-2 weeks" that was promised.2: It decays fast. 7 months ago I could get 5-6 days of standby time. This battery has now been reduced to being 1-2 days. The "zero memory effect" claim is also worthless.Personally, I'd avoid the SCH-3500 at all costs. While it seems like it should be a decent phone, it has a myriad of problems. I'm currently on my second, the first one died after less than a year of very light use. Pick a different phone and battery system.

 review/summary: Save your money for another product!
review/text: This is an overpriced, under-engineered and generally inferior product. The sound quality on it is good, and it certainly is more discreet than other competing products (people have thought I was talking to myself while wearing it), but there are better options out there.You will love this for the few months prior to it breaking. I have had mine for around 4 months and the prongs are destroyed. The ones for other phones do not do this because of their design. If you put a pad on the earpiece it is much more comfortable and won't slip from your ear as much. It does increase safety in the car. For thirty dollars Nokia could design something better.The Jabra one I own seems a little more sturdy, and costs less to replace (if it breaks). My reccomendation, is that if you aren't concerned with looks too much, go for the Jabra. So far I have not had any trouble with it, besides the fact that it is huge. If you won't be using the Nokia headset much, try your luck with it, but don't say I didn't warn you...

review/summary: The best I've used so far - excellent volume
 review/text: I've used about a half dozen after market ear pieces over the last year (most of them bought from a large nationwide discount department store), and finally decided to go with Nokia's.This one wins when it comes to volume. Every other 'cheap' aftermarket imitation I've used makes it very difficult to hear the other party while contending with highway/road noise (especially the Jabra gel hands free). With the Nokia hands free, I actually had to turn the volume down half way for one of my calls because it was too loud.Just like any other hands free piece, you will have to treat it gently (I've learned this the hard way). I don't think any of them are designed to handle abuse. Finally - I've had some after market headsets that had problems maintaining good contact with the phone. Only a few locked onto the phone and maintained contact 100% of the time. So far I haven't noticed any problems with Nokia's headset. The round ear bud might not fit everyone, and I haven't tried it on any long phone calls (yet), but it was initially very comfortable (more than the Jabra gel's I've used in the past).Overall - I am initially very pleased with it.

 review/summary: Not a Poor Design
 review/text: ... The headset works just great and is one of the best items that Nokia has come up with. Potential buyers of this product should know that it is a good purchase to make. I've had mine for over a year and have never had to replace it. Perhaps it is David or the anonymous "wireless customer's" handling of the equipment that is causing it to continuosly break. I use the headset constantly during a normal work week and sporadically on the weekends. I use it sitting down, walking around outside and driving in my car. I've never experienced ear soreness from the headset where I have felt the need to move the ear bud from one ear to the other. The reception that I receive and the feedback from those I am speaking with have been positive. Granted, the cloth covering for the ear bud did fall off but that was after many months of continued use and from rolling around in my tote. I located the cloth covering and put it back on the ear piece. No problem. But, even without the covering, the ear bud does not pose any discomfort whatsoever. I continue to use the earbud headset as it has added comfort and convenience to my life. I recommend this product to anyone who is interested.

 review/summary: be a safer driver
 review/text: Was skeptical of clarity at first but was surprised - no problems in that area. Purchased for hands free driving and because of concerns of possible radiation with built in antennas. Ear bud is a bit uncomfortable at first and tends to slip out with alot of head movement. No problems when just sitting still. Cord to phone is adequate length - haven't had any disconnections.

 review/summary: could be better....
 review/text: I've only had my headset for a week and have not been able to get use to how uncomfortable it feels in your ear. The first ten minutes of use seems ok, but longer conversations can be painful. Not the conversation - but the ear ache. Sound quality was good from both ends. It is also not a friendly adapter when it comes to connecting and unconnecting - I always feel like I am going to damage the prongs. The ear plug could have been designed better for a comfort, more snug fit. It really is a very ear-ittating feeling - sorry, I had to go there. I am not quite satisfied with this product and will only use it until I can find something better.

 review/summary: Nokia 6100 series headphone
 review/text: This earpiece has been a godsend. I can drive, shop, or do anything that's non-strenuous and keep a phone conversation going indefinitely. The phone has a setting that allows the phone/earpiece to ring once and you are connected. No reaching for the phone or even the connect button on the earpiece wire. There is a point when the earpiece does tire the ear from insertion but it is not a handicap nor a reason not to buy it. The only caution is to be careful not to snag the wire and to be sure the main phone unit is securely attached to your belt or clothing.

 review/summary: Confirmed, poor design
 review/text: It's a very convient head-set that works very well, WHEN it works. I agree with some of the posts that the design is not robust. It falls apart within a month of use. I've had to replace mine several times now. The wire that connects to the microphone is poorly designed so that if you put enough strain on it, which is not much, you will start having static, noice, and complete cut-off of sound issues. If you choose to buy this product, buy several as a back up if you can affort it or just buy other aftermarket products that are cheaper.

 review/summary: great item...when it works
 review/text: I bought three of these when they first came out for me and two associates. Within 2 weeks, mine stopped working and shortly thereafter so did the other two. I have since replaced 6 of them and my associates replaced them twice and gave up. The little prongs on the headset that insert into the phone keep breaking. For the limited time the product was functioning I loved it. True the foam earpiece fell off immediately, but even without it, I found it comfortable. I only wish the darn thing would work for more than a few days. I have since given up replacing them and I wish they would improve the design because they are very convenient. One last thing, because it is so small people who are not familiar with headsets are going to look at you like you've gone nuts...talking to yourself when actually the phone is being used.

 review/summary: Cheap... and it works!
 review/text: I was doubtful about this gizmo when I first saw it. An in-the-ear phone and a mike dangling far away from the mouth? Bu the AT&amp;T phone center salesman was wearing one, and he seemed to like it. So I bought one.And son of a gun- it DOES work. I've used it driving, sitting in front of a computer and paddling in a kayak, with the phone safely tucked in a waterproof bag- and I have never had a complaint about audio quality from the caller at the other end.It's just about unbreakable. There's no mike boom or headband, or any large plastic parts. Just an earplug, a mike, a clip, and the wire connecting them. Simple, elegant and functional.

 review/summary: Good sound quality, but uncomfortable
 review/text: I've had the earbud for several months now. The sound quality is excellent - better than my handset. However, the foam cover for the earpiece fell off the first day, and the design doesn't have any mechanism to hold it in place in your ear. Because of this, it keeps falling out of my ear while I'm driving, which makes it even more distracting than holding the handset!

 review/text: While I really appreciate this accessory and the freedom of movement that it allows (no more crick in the neck while trying to precariously clench my phone between ear and shoulder), the ear bud itself is uncomfortable. I can't hold a coversation for longer than a few minutes without my ear beginning to ache. I thought at first that I must just have ears that are an anomoly of nature, but after sharing my peeve with friends, I've found that quite a few other folks have the same gripe about this product.

 review/summary: Impressed a cynic
review/text: I was pretty cynical about the voice quality possible via a microphone that sits a fair distance away from my mouth. But I was proven wrong. This thing works great. Not only can I hear the person on the other end of the phone with great clarity, they can hear me. Even when I'm in my car with the window open, it completely shields out the background noise. I've had expensive installed car kits where this is not the case.Also, I find the earpiece to be quite comfortable and secure.My only gripe is that earbuds in general (no, I'm not ragging on Nokia) encourage people to look like dorks, walking around town talking into the air! Get a clue, people!

review/summary: Poor Design
 review/text: Within the past 5 months of having my cell phone, I have had to replace the hands-free earbud on the average of one every other week. The main reason: POOR ENGINEERING &amp;/or DESIGN. Every time you would sit down with the phone on your belt clip, the point of contact is always at the base of the phone right where your headset is attached, thus causing the fine wires coming out of the attachment to break. Also, the two plastic tabs that attach the headset to the cell phone are always breaking off ruining the use of the headset. These are the two major set backs on the &quot;Design.&quot; Just briefly a note on comfort of the earpiece. After a couple of uses, you will loose the padding on the earbud. After a hour or so with the earpiece placed properly into the ear it becomes very uncomfortable thus having to switch ears and causing the mic to be further from one's mouth making it very difficult for the other party to hear. My solution: Redesign the earpiece to the shape of one's inner ear. The attachment needs to be either a ninety degree angle (so wires come out to the side not bottom) or built to mount on the side of cell phone. After many e-mails to Nokia and calls they still will not accept the idea that it is ideed a poor design.

 review/summary: Mixed blessing
 review/text: While this device's output sound quality benefits from the fact that it sits literally millimeters from your eardrum, don't believe the hype about the microphone, which dangles too far from the mouth to function adequately. For maximal mike sound quality, you'll have to hold the mike near your mouth. Not a great look in traffic.Did I mention the flimsy construction? Expect to replace this device every 3-4 months. If the connector doesn't fall apart, the earbud disintegrates. That said, genuine Nokia quality is way better than that rendered by tinny knockoffs, and the audio quality is also far superior to that produced by the marginally more sophisticated devices that hook over your ear and place a shoddy mini-boom before your mouth.I'm still waiting to hear if these gizmos really cut down the celphone radiation that causes eye and brain disorders. BTW, I'm about to buy my third one of these.

 review/summary: All in all quite satisfied
 review/text: After a year and a half, I am only on my second earbud. This has proved an indispensable accessory for me. My only real complaint about it is that the ringer tone does not sound in my ear. If my phone is clipped to my belt in a noisy environment such as a hockey game, I cannot hear it ring. All I get is a faint click in the earpiece, which could also be caused by the low-battery notification. In the car, however, it is great. I use it with the Nokia car holster and I find the combination quite convenient. The plug on this is prone to damage easily, but my current one continues to work adequately despite a slight amount of damage. I could also wish to boost the sound level a little, but the people I am talking to have no trouble hearing me. It took me a little while to get used to the microphone working fine despite being well away from my mouth.

 review/text: I had a time getting used to the earpiece but it did help me use the phone safely in the car. But the jack used to connect it to the phone is flimsy. The caveat mentioned in the description came true for me - the prongs on each side of the jack just snapped off one day. Now I can't plug it in the phone. I wish someone had warned me. I would have been more careful.

review/summary: Great product!
 review/text: I just ordered two headsets because the one I got with my phone stopped working. Mind you, I didn't treat it very well and even after stepping on the ear piece twice (and keeping it held together with a rubber band) the thing was still working! It was only after repeated abuse that it finally fell apart. I figure that with two I'll cut down on having to transport it to and fro, as much. This is my first time ordering from Amazon and I'm hoping I won't be disappointed. Oh, and in response to the review dated 2-27-03 (cell phones and brain cancer in mice), the two studies mentioned have not been corroborated by any future studies conducted on the matter. See the FDA's reports (www.fda.gov/cellphones) and extensive international research compiled in a report by the Medical College of Wisconsin (www.mcw.edu).

 review/summary: Great earbud overall
 review/text: I really like the convenience (very light and folds up easily) and quality of this earbud. The only drawback is that it sometimes makes an annoying buzzing sound. This can be mitigated by twisting the plug around (go figure) or moving the phone around -- kind of like trying to pick up a radio station. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds, but it's something to be aware of. The volume and quality of sound (when there's no buzzing) is really impressive, and the microphone picks up my voice very well even when I'm driving and twisting my head around to keep an eye on traffic.

 review/summary: Best on market, but not that good
 review/text: I would agree with most other reviewers in saying that this is probably the best hands-free set for this phone on the market. I'm buying my third one. That said, I'm buying my third one in less than three years-- yes, this is not a durable headset. Because cell phones were recently shown to cause brain cell death in rats after only two hours of (GSM) use (Leif Salford, Lund University Hospital, Sweden as published in Environmental Health Perspectives), I use my headset all the time. I am very careful with the headset and its cord, but even if you're careful you should expect a high burn rate with frequent usage.The microphone is sensitive to wind and to mid- and high-pitched noises, more than a cell phone without the attachment. So beware if you're planning on using it outside.With all of its drawbacks, it still seems to be the best product on the market.

 review/text: (This review is based on use with the Nokia 8260)About the best thing I can say about this hands-free set is that no one can tell I'm using it (or at least when I switch to it, I've never gotten a comment from the person on the other end that I suddenly sound different). Reception through the ear bud is equally clear (you'll probably want to turn the volume down on your phone when using it).I don't have much more to say except that I'm very satisfied with the product. I use my cell phone as my primary phone, so for long conversations either walking or sitting it's been a great relief.

 review/summary: Money's Worth
 review/text: My wife and I recently upgraded phones to the Nokia 6555. As usual the headsets from the old Nokia's wouldn't operate in the new ones. After researching prices for the exact (supposedly) Nokia earbub headsets, we settled on two of these sets. Shipment was FAST, however neither worked in either of the phones. I think we paid $2.95 each, with shipping it was around $ 17.00. I did'nt even bother to return them ( I should have), but I just figured that we nearly got our money's worth. Next time I will go for the higher priced set.

 review/summary: Finally found ear piece for Nokia
 review/text: I finally found an ear piece for my 2 year old Nokia phone. However, the ear insertion doesn't stay in my ear and constantly falls out. So, I'm using my hand to keep the ear piece in my ear. Also, hearing volume is not effective. Annoying, but can't do anything about it.However, I've discovered you can find stuff on Amazon and that's a good thing.

 review/summary: Handy little gizmo, but with drawbacks - and Very BREAKABLE
 review/text: As a useful device, what I like most about this is its convenience, and the fact that you can carry it in your pocket.Advantages:1. It's truly hands free because you can both answer your calls and hang up on them without having to find the cell phone it's attached to.2. Not quite as breakable as other similar products I've used, but it will still come to pieces within 2-3 months no matter what you do.The three biggest drawbacks are:1. (And this one is the worst) If there's any background noise, or if you're outdoors and there's even the slightest puff of wind, then people will have a very difficult time hearing you, and you'll get a lot of annoyed requests to talk without it (to put it mildly)2. It does hurt the ear after a while, especially if you wear glasses of any kind, because of the added pressure.3. It slips out of your ear easily4. Despite advantage #2, above, it will eventually break if you're not very careful with it. I need to keep it attached while I'm rushing around, and sometimes I can't take the time to put it away as carefully as I should, and have to shove it into my pocket or untangle it from something. As a result, its life expectancy is usually under two months for people who use it like I do.

 review/summary: Very durable, great quality
 review/text: This earbud came with my 8290 and 3390. I thought I lost it, so I bought a Jabra earset (it was free after rebate after all..). So I found out where this one went - It was in my pocket and I washed it. I took it out, let it dry and it works perfectly! At first the mic didn't work but once I left it out for a few hours it was ok.That's what I call durable! You can rely on this to last a long time. I'm still using mine even after I washed it! Don't know if it's worth the 24.99 though. That sounds a bit expensive, but for this type of quality it's well worth it!The Jabra by the way, is collecting dust. The ear gels are really uncomfortable and it falls out of my ear. The on/off button is hard to press, you have to press it hard for it to hang up or use the voice dialing. I'm glad it came out to free after the rebates - Otherwise I would've been out $10 for somethign I would never use! The Nokia brand earbud beats Jabra hands down!

 review/summary: Pretty nice, and better than the others....
 review/text: I bought this earbud as an upgrade to the earbud which came with my AT&amp;T,Nokia 8260. I also bought the Jabra earbud - to compare both. This earbud works quite well. Compared to the Jabra the sound quality going into as well as coming out of this earbud is a little less clear. However, the major advantage of this earbud is that it doesn't pick up as much annoying wind noise or any of that rustling clothes noise. This earbud is sensitive enough but, not to sensitive to be obnoxious. I kept this earbud - It works well enough and is comfortable enough. The other though it comes with an assortment of ear &quot;gels&quot;,is just to complicated and surprisingly uncomfortable for it own good.

 review/summary: This item is awsome!
 review/text: It must have saved me a couple of times while driving and trying to talk on the phone or answer a call.Also, the law here is it's illegal to drive while talking on the phone so it saves you from some dumb tickets.Being 29.99, it's a bit expensive, for a mic, earbud, and mini plug. You have to be careful not to stretch the wire, as you can break the fragile thin cables inside the rubber jacket, which should have been less streatchy.

 review/summary: I was skeptical at first
 review/text: The earbud came with my 3360. I have never used an earbud before and was skeptical about it -- I couldn't imagine it staying in my ear. But it does, easily, and I use it all the time. It doesn't fall out when walking, and no one at the other end has ever complained about the microphone quality. I love it.

review/summary: EXCELLENT HOLSTER AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE.
 review/text: If you own the Samsung SCH850 or SCH8500, you won't find a better holster. I tried 2 others before this was available, 1 leather and 1 similar to this holster. With the second one, the phone dislodged itself from my belt 3 times in the first 2 days and fell to the concrete. Trust me when I say this holster &quot;really&quot; works and my phone has never dislodged itself even once. It is comfortable and the antenna no longer pokes me in the side as it did with both of the previous holsters. If you don't carry this phone in your pocket and want a holster, I highly recommend this one. And, you can't beat the price.

 review/summary: Awesome for a month!
 review/text: The belt clip worked as great as the other reviewers claim. It held my Samsung SCH850 phone within easy access and it never popped out unexpectedly or fell off of my belt. It was nice to have a holder that fit my phone perfectly.However, after a month of normal use, the plastic clip broke off while walking for no apparent reason. My phone fell to the ground but it withstood the beating (thankfully!)Despite this setback, I'm going to give this clip another try. I'm hoping it was just a fluke that this one clip was made poorly. I'll update my review again depending on my next clip!

 review/summary: Great product if you want to break your new phone...!
 review/text: I bought a new SCH8500 and it's fallen out of this holster at least 4 times in the past 2 months! Sure it seems to lock in quite nicely, but as soon as you nudge into something, the phone falls to the ground! My phone is now broken because of this and I'm waiting to recieve a replacement; If they'll even send me a replacement! You can bet I'll buy full leather phone protector when/if I get my new phone back. Do yourself a big fat favor and get a holser that protects the entire phone. All you need to do is drop the phone just once and it's all over...!

 review/summary: This is a poor design - Don't buy it!
 review/text: I had mine 30 days before I heard the sound of plastic snapping as I sat down. The problem is that the belt clip pin is not locked in place and over a very short time it works itself free on one end. The next thing you know, the hard plastic is breaking. Glue fixes the problem, but within two weeks of use, the action repeats. Buy something else!

 review/summary: Good until it breaks
 review/text: I found this to be a good holster though the pictures made it seem thinner than it actualy was. The clip broke off of the holster that I got my girlfriend for her phone, and I first assumed that it was because of rough use. About a mounth later the clip broke off in the same place on mine when the seatbelt in my car pulled on it. This is probibly somthing that could be fixed by the manufacturor, the plastic seems week in that spot, and I'd recommended getting one of the other availible cases for this phone.

 review/summary: Buy this, but also buy the cheaper holster, and YOU decide!
 review/text: Just a little background on my phone usage - I have a 3000 minute plan and use most of it every month, so the 8500 sees a lot of action in and out of the holster! I started out with the cheap holster, and thought I'd have a better holster for twice the cost. I'm going back to my cheap holster. I've had this holster about 2 months now, and I have 2 complaints. #1) In my opinion, it is NOT easier to take in and out of than my cheap holster ... #2) It sticks out a little more than my cheap holster(to accomodate optional thicker battery?) and because of this, my phone has gotten caught on things and has dropped on the ground twice. The cheaper holster mounts the phone &quot;face in&quot; (battery out) and doesn't stick out as much and never got flipped out of the holster. Bottom line? This holster looks good, but it is difficult to get the phone out quickly, and it seems to get caught on stuff more often. Cheap holster... doesn't look as pretty, but functions better for me. Try both and see which one is for you.

 review/text: This is a great product. I should know. I have bought four or five. The only problem with the product is that due to my carlessness, I end up breaking the holster. I forget to take it off when I sit in a chair. Many times the clip will catch on the side of the chair and then break off. I love the holster for convenience. It is very easy to use and the phone fits very snugly. I recommend it. Just don't forget to take it off before sitting down in a chair.

 review/text: Hey, for all of you 8500 owners, this holster really gets the job done. I actually wanted a leather holster instead of the one I have now, but on the recommendation of my Sprint PCS sales associate, I chose this one. I hardly know that the holster is on my belt and the clip is really strong. The phone is almost a part of me with the holster and phone. My phone used to fall out of my pocket and drop and I got fed up with that. I have only dropped my phone once with the holster and that was while I was attempting to eat a sandwich with my greasy hands and answer the phone at the same time. This holster is worth the 10 dollars and I have gotten many compliments about the look of my phone on the holster.

 review/text: I've used this holster daily for the past five months, with the cell clipped alongside my pager. The holster adds little to no bulk to the phone, and you can unclip the phone with one hand.I can understand other's concerns about durability, but so far, I've had no problems at all. The clip seems to hold the phone in place securely for me. In five months, I have had the phone come unclipped once when the seatbelt hit the release.From my experience, this holster is well worth the price.

 review/summary: Great but watch out for seatbelts
 review/text: I too enjoyed this holster and its ease of use for about four or five months; apart from seeming to get slightly looser, the phone never fell out of the holster. The phone was very easy to access and the only advantage of a rotating holster is that it is a bit more comfortable. Everything was going fine until I took my seatbelt off one day and the plastic clip attachment broke off. I use a leather rotating holster now, which is a little more comfortable when sitting but not nearly as accessible as the Samsung holster. On the whole, I recommend the plastic holster for its ease of use but it is sometimes uncomfortable when sitting and can break because of its rigidity.
