 review/text: Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them.

 review/text: I bought the Jabra ear-piece first and when I read the reviews for these gels, I just had to try them. Didn't last long. There were two problems.1. the earpiece would fall out of the gels. Not great at all.2. if you have small ears....Dont bother. They hurt after a short while.

 review/text: I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.

 review/summary: Better than the Palm case by a mile.
 review/text: One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.

 review/text: This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.

Its so nice not to worry if you have enough juice to finish the call, or sweat the fact that you forgot to charge the phone last night. With this battery it'll wait till tomorrow. Just checked mine after two days off the charger. The phone still shows a fully charged battery. I have never had this battery go dead in use.My only concern was if the larger size would require a larger phone holder. It adds only a 1/8 inch in thickness, if that. The back fits just as well as the OEM, same color and everything. This is an easy decision.

So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola. I absolutely love my Nokia 3120. It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great design. I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception. It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.

 review/summary: Tiny phone for tiny hands (i.e. men need not apply)
 review/text: I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC

The only problem I've had with it is that I have had a couple dropped calls, but I barely have reception in my room anyway, so thats why. but GREAT phone!

 review/summary: Sure to break at some point
 review/text: I purchased two of these phones at a discounted price when I signed up for a Cingular plan. Both phones are already broken and I have only had them for 6 months. My wife's phone had the corner of the phone crack and then break off making it hard to open the face without having the screen slip out of the hing. My phones screen just got a great big blob of color in the middle so I can't read anything on the screen. The phone was great while they worked, light weight, easy to use, good ring and opptions... I'm just not happy that it lasted only 6 months. If you do buy this phone be sure to get insurance since it will probably break at some point.

 review/summary: First cellphone and IT ROCKS!!!
 review/text: The LG C1300 is a sleek, small and very nice cell phone!! Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few "cool" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror. If you are considering in buying a cheap yet great quality design, BUY THIS!!! Oh by the way, Cingular ROCKS!!!!

 review/summary: Worthless
 review/text: This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.

 review/text: The phone can ding up a little easier than what I am use to with cell phones. But overall, I am pretty sastified with this one. I love how small it is and how I can stuff it in a pocket or purse, or even just carry it around in my hand. The ring tones selection is good and the vibration is good as well. Most cell phones I can never use on vibrate, because I simply do not notice when the phone rings. This little sucker will let you know. Not a perfect cell phone, but no where close to being the worst I have ever owned over the last 11 years!

 review/text: I have not had one single problem with this phone. I can hear people clearly when I make outbound calls and recieve inbound calls. Loaded with features. Reliable phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have had nothing but problems with them. (Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options.

 review/text: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).

The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!

 review/text: I always want to protect my phone, and this case does just that.Pro:If covers majority of the phonethe back is a hard material (probably cardboard)Comes with a clip for your belt (which I have no used)COns:It makes the keyboard much smaller, have to get use to the leather being close to the side of the keyboard.bit of a hassle plugging the phone in.The price.The notification bar is kinda hard to drag down.If you don't mind the cons and want to protect your phone, then I would suggest buying this.EDIT::: Dec 22, 2010Well it has been over a little of three months since I had the case and I am now just noticing wear and tear. The side on the front right have been detached and now I can see the cardboard. The flap that "keeps it in place" is now tearing (just the sides). The front left side is tearing off and that is all I notice.

 review/text: I got this case for my husband about 3 weeks ago and it has worked great! The case has a good bit of padding all around which makes it very protective. We didn't use the clip included because he prefers to have it in his pocket so I don't know how the clip actually works.The only setbacks to this product is that he has to take the case out to charge it on his iphone dock we have because the case is too thick for this, but I'm sure that if you have different accessories it may not be an issue for you. Next setback is the fact that the edges on the front of the case make it a bit hard to reach the keys at the edge when typing.But I am willing to sacrifice a little bit (very little) of easiness in order to avoid accidents!I am definitely recommending this product!

 review/summary: Possibly the best out there, but one prob with Motorola v551
 review/text: Very comfortable and fits well, very light-weight, good battery life, great sound quality and volume on both ends of the conversation (unless too windy). I only have one complaint when using the BT250 with my Motorola v551 phone: Every time I turn on the headset to establish the [already paired] link with my phone, the phone immediately goes into voice-dialing mode (i.e., "Say name now ... say name louder"). Because I usually don't say anything when it does this, the normal harmless result is "Voice name not found," but a few times my phone somehow matched my silence with one of my recorded voice tags, and I found myself disconnecting a call I didn't want to make in the first place.This did not happen when I used my v551 with a Logitech bluetooth headset (which did not fit me well, causing me not to be able to hear the speaker most of the time).Jabra support first told me to pair the headset to the phone again, this time using the alternate method for phones that support the hands-free profile. This did result in a few enhanced features, but it didn't stop the unwanted voice-dialing. My next email from Jabra support said that this "is normal behavior when you hold the answer/end button on the headset," and they suggested that I either turn voice dialing off on my phone, or use the phone (instead of the headset) to disconnect the link between the two units. Well, there is only one place I can find on the v551 for turning off voice dialing (under the "headset" options), but this doesn't stop the irritating problem. Using the phone to disconnect and re-establish the link is much less convenient. It DOES stop the problem, however, but only if the headset remains turned on (but disconnected) the whole time, adversely affecting battery life. If I disconnect using the phone, then turn the headset off, the voice-dialing thing will happen when I try to re-establish the link, even if I try to do it from the phone just before turning the headset on (which doesn't work anyway).I must say again, in spite of the above, this is truly a great headset. I'm pretty sure (from other reviews) that the problem I have does not affect most phones, and it is primarily just an irritant that I have grown used to, and it only occurs once each time I turn the headset on in order to establish the link.

 review/summary: Not bad, but....
 review/text: I bought this for my wife a while ago and pairs with her samsung slider phone (can't remember the model number off of the top of my head) quite easily. I've had occassion to use it myself (when I have to use her phone) so I feel that I can confidently rate it.Overall, it isn't too bad for a handsfree. There are times when I call her (even on a land line) and it sounds like she's digitally stuttering. In my opinion; not good. It's realatively light weight and you can wear it for a long period of time without alot of discomfort (she does wear it quite often during the day). The different ear pieces give you the ability to give a custom fit feel to it, which is nice. I've read in some of the other reviews for the bt250v (a similar model) that it has a tendency to fall off if you move your head too quickly; I can see why.Truth be told, I almost purchased one of these for my own cell phone use (I own a Motorola v360) but I read the reviews for the Plantronics Voyager PLT 510. :) I'm glad I did - but that's another review.

 review/text: I gave one of these to my father (70) so he could let my sister (35) and mother (67)try it out on their EVO Shift phones from Sprint. About 4 months later he called me up and said he wanted 2 more ordered because he wanted to keep it for himself but both my sister and my mother also wanted it. He said it is helpful for entering information on his phone because his fingers are "large and dry" and sometimes his phone doesn't seem to know he's trying to touch things on the screen. I saw a review about it not working with the Nook Color however my mother uses hers with her Nook Color as well as her phone. She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook. I have one and it works fine on my phone and iPad. The mini size is good for keeping it with us when we are not at home. I keep mine tucked into the case and very seldom use the ear phone port attachment. My mother and sister use the ear phone port attachment to keep it with their phones when their phones are stowed in their purses.

 review/text: I have only had this cable for about two months so have not noticed any of the 'wear and tear' on the cable line as mentioned in other reviews. The cable has functioned great for me.It is also in a nice convenient, compact size that allows me to carry it with me to the office and on the road. If it continues to perform as it has been I would say this is a great buy for those on the go.

 review/summary: OK If You Know What You're Getting
 review/text: I was amazed when this phone arrived with a Hebrew instruction booklet and carried the marque of the Orange cellphone service in Israel. I found an English language version of the instructions online. All I wanted was a telephone, and that is what I got. It does not do anything as sophisticated as texting, let alone take pictures or hook up to the web. But that's all right. It works great as a cellphone. The sound is clear and the buttons are large enough to push without making mistakes. I signed up with T-mobile and use the five faves service with no problem, and with the quad phone I can go overseas and know I can get a local SIM card for temporary use as needed. I recommend this phone as a phone for those who want nothing more, but understand that that's what you're getting, and be prepared to look for English instructions elsewhere.

 review/summary: Excellent headphones that also work with hearing aids
 review/text: I purchased the 590A a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier with it. It doesn't need the adapter to pair with my blackberry pearl. It's very comfortable, and the battery life is excellent - the phone will run out of juice before the headset does. I am on the phone most of the day, and this is the first headset I've found that I can wear and use all day without having to make constant adjustments.The other thing I really like about the headset is that I can use it with my hearing aids (ITC style) without feedback. The earpieces sit on top of the ear but not so close as to cause squealing. The volume and clarity are very good. These headphones make it much, much easier for me to use the phone, and I'm glad I bought them.

 review/summary: Not Great for Ventrilo
 review/text: I bought this product as a replacement for my often broken computer headsets. The battery life is great, good sound, and great microphone. The only thing I wasn't aware of is that you can't use stereo sound and voice at the same time. You can easily switch between the two with your control panel however, so its not a game stopping issue, just not the fabled PC Headset replacement we're all hoping for.

I don't use it that often (about once a week) so I have no idea how long the battery lasts if used on a daily basis, but since I've had it, I've only had to charge it once.

 review/summary: Don't get this case!
 review/text: I want to be really fair, Krusell makes very high quality cases, but this phone is just a pain to make case for.This Krusell case fits very well, however, because the BB has microphone underneath the key pads the plastic cover on this case will make you sound very muffled and weak. This phone doesn't have a "microphone opening" like other phones, so the only way to expose the mic is not to have a case. I have received complaints from customers and coworkers that I sound horrible. The thickness of the case makes it very difficult to use the thumbwheel. Overall, this case will degrade the functionality of the phone.

 review/summary: Technology At It's Best!
 review/text: I bought this to replace my one-year-old Samsung SCH-A670.Here are my opinions on some of the RAZR's features-VZ Navigator-Great for when you're driving and you're lost, and when you don't have a navigational system in your car, like I don't.V Cast-Great for when you want to watch short movies or full music videos while on the go and you don't have access to a computer. The only con is that it only gets covrage in certain areas.Speakerphone-You can't always have your wireless telephone up to your ear, and the speakerphone helps with that, a feature my SCH-A670 didn't have!Ultra-Sleek Design-Wanna have the latest? The RAZR has the thinnest design!Camera/Video RAZR-It has a 1-megapixel digital camera with a 4X digital optical zoom. It can capture flix (video), too! But, you can't send anybody flix who doesn't have flix compatibility.Color-The gray color is in style right now, and the RAZR has that color!Overall-Since I bought the RAZR a couple of months ago, it has made me happy, except the battery died on me 2 months after I got it. I've always heard the battery life was short, and now I agree!

 review/text: I bought the $15.00 1GB microSD card and installed it the first day.Plugged the USB I had for my camera into the phone after formatting the card and downloaded a bunch of songs onto the micro by just drag and drop with windows. Dropped them into the Motorola/shared/audio folder.The phone recognized them right away. I moved some to the phone after it was unplugged and then realized the entire song could be used as ring tones. So I deleted the ones on my phone downloaded MP3 converter and cut into my favorite 20 songs (being careful not to overwrite any.) I saved them into the same folder on the phone with RT in front and moved them from the card to the phone after it was unplugged from the computer. That worked great for ringtones.When I want to download a picture from the phone I just make a copy from the phone to the card then plug the phone into the computer to take it out of the motorola/shared/pictures folder.No need for phone tools...

 review/summary: Verizon V3m cellphone
 review/text: I bought this phone in Aug 04 and have generally been very happy with it.The battery life is not as long as my wife's phone, but I have talked up to 4 hours in a day without any problem. I generally recharge it after 2-3 days and average about an hour of talk time each day. Even down at one bar, it works fine.The size is great! I really wanted a phone that I could drop into my pocket and not need a bulky case in order to protect it. The V3m fills the bill perfectly. I also really enjoy that there is no external antennae. The mp3 player works fairly well, but it does not have all the features of a dedicated MP3. It will let you put together playlists and play songs, which is enough for me.The most important thing with a cell phone (to me) is call quality. This is where I have been the happiest. I have used it in the St Louis area, small town SW Oklahoma, Fort Worth, along I-40 to California, and now live about halfway between San Francisco and Sacremento. Call quality is crystal clear with no static!Overall I am very happy with the phone.

 review/summary: Solid phone, pricey features
 review/text: The Motorazr V3m is a solid phone- making and recieving calls is easy and effective, the operating system is consistent, and it looks small and stylish on the outside. However, once you go beyond simple phone tasks, things get more complicated.First, the exterior: it is sleek and thin, and looks very good. One problem is that the outside tends to smudge, but this can be corrected by wiping the phone off. The keys are nice, which is amazing because they are so thin. The d-pad in the middle is a little hard to use, though- the phone could have used a little more space around it.As for basic features, almost everything is very accessible and intuitive (with the exception of the camera, which is hard to get to from the menus). The contacts software allows you to add multiple numbers for one entry at once, which is a bonus. Settings are easy to find and change. Messages are straight-foward, however, if you miss more than one message and then say "yes" at the screen that asks if you want to check them, you are taken to the newest message, which can be confusing if the earlier message is connected to it.Now, the extra features that Verizon advertises are the disappointing part. I know this is common for phones, but just remember that what is advertised does not come with the phone for free. You must pay pretty hefty fees for web browzing, Vcast (video service), downloading ringtones and using the navigation system. Even the games are only demos and can only be used once. I have tried the navigation software as well as the browser, and both are top-quality. It is up to you to decide whether you want to pay the fees ($10/mth and $6/mth respectively). Music is also difficult to transfer from your PC- I have had no success trying a USB cord I had at home, so you might need to spend another $20 to get the propritary cord. The bluetooth software with the phone does not support file transfer.Overall, a good phone for everyday needs, just make sure you know what you are getting into.

 review/summary: Great phone, make the leap to this Razr its worth it
 review/text: I have used Nokia from day 1, but I decided to try this Razr, because I had heard that Motorola fixed a lot of the problems that the original Razr had. This phone has great reception, brilliant screen, awesome camera for pictures, bluetooth works very well with hands free link in my car and very easy to text with. I haven't downloaded music yet so can't comment on that aspect. This phone is also very nice looking I must admit.The only problem is the ringtones that come with this phone are awful, they force you to go buy ringtones which I think is absurd. Great phone otherwise, highly recommended.

 review/summary: Cool design with some "need to get used to" features
 review/text: I definitely like the phone for it's slender design and features. the only thing that gets me is getting used to actually using the phone. trying to make sense of call history, or to quickly access some of your items can be trying for someone who is not as tech savvy with cell phones. i enjoy the phone and it does what it supposed to do very well... make and receive calls!clear audio quality, no dropped calls so far and a HUGE screen to see things. after reading the guide and sitting down with the phone for an hour or two and re-programming it,... it's a lot more user-friendly. it's as good as any other phone for text msgs.good battery life and if looking for accessories, definitely look for a snug holster to avoid this phone from feeling loose in its case. You can also find good accessories at Radioshack.

 review/text: I bought this adapter last week from a local retailer. After reading the reviews I was ready to take it back. I did a test run of it today and the sound is pretty good, better than the cheaper one I had before. The WOW and extra stars is for the durability of the charger. It fell out of the car and got run over. With the plastic casing in pieces I plugged it in on a whim and low and behold it still worked. It is now held together by electrical tape and duct tape but I am pretty pleased with everything overall.

 review/text: This headset works beautifully, it is lightweight and very comfortable, and the noise reducing microphone is highly effective. My first Logitech headset (the Mobile Freedom, model #F0228A) was larger; the flexible roating clip snapped in half after less than one year of use. Logitech was fabulous and promptly sent me a free replacement headset (the Logitech Mobile Traveller, model #F0399A). This is a smaller, sleeker headset, and even more comfortable than the first one. However, the clip snapped in half after only 4 months of use (mind you, I coddle my phone and headset). This time, Logitech sent me a replacement clip; it's still in one piece 5 months later. I would have rated this 5 stars but for the frail clip.

 review/text: As much as I like the Motorola V60 it seems that Motorola is not intent on producing a nice case for the phone. As usual, Body Glove has stepped up for Motorola as they seem to do for most of the cell phone manufactures. The phone looks great on its own but if you want to protect it, this case is excellent. The fit is very good, with openings and plastic where they should be. This case was made for the V60 and only the V60. If you want to protect your phone without loosing its slim design the price and quality are worth the investment. If you are looking for a protective case for your V60 phone, this is the one to get, it is slim, durable, attractive and a perfect fit.

 review/text: A few friends bought the 600 when it first came out--nightmare quality problems. But it looks like Palm's worked the bugs out, and prices are coming down because of the 650. I have Cingular service and it works great just about anywhere; if you travel around the country Cingular or Verizon are safe (but relatively expensive) bets. The only difficulty I have with the 600 is the keypad--the keys are small packed tightly together. Otherwise, screen navigation is easy, battery life good, phone sound quality better than any standard cell phone I've used.

 review/summary: Great phone - just don't get it with Verizon Wireless
 review/text: Well, as an early adapter, I guess I should be used to taking it hard. I bought Verizon's PalmOne Treo 600 the first day it came out - over a year after AT&T;, Sprint, and other comapnies released it. My plan is 400 anytime minutes, unlimited in-network calling, unlimited nights and weekend, and $5 for Internet access a month. Unless I go over, it should cost me $49.95 a month. I just got my first bill.$1,641.66.It turns out that the connection to the Internet doesn't shut off - even if you chose "Disconnect" from the web browser's menu. Even if you turn off the unit. It continues to ping the Internet looking for data every six minutes. Hence my bill show some 1023-minute calls.Steve in Verizon's data division said they've received a lot of calls on this issue and isn't sure why they even offer the $5 web-only feature, when customers need to get the $49.95/month unlimited data transfer or deal with $1,000-plus monthly bills. When I asked if there was a way to stop the pinging every six minutes, I was told no, "it's a data phone first and a cell phone second."Interesting, as my friends who have the phone with other carriers have never had this problem. Interesting, as I was never told this when I bought it. All I wanted was a freakin' cell/PDA combo, so I don't have to carry both with me, making me look like I'm sporting a chubby in two pockets at once. With Verizon, the cost for doing so is $44.95 plus your calling plan a month, which for me will come to about $100.After 58 minutes, I was told my bill should be adjusted within 24 to 48 hours.Also, on Verizon Wireless's PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone web page it lists a 5 MB transfer for only $24.95. When I asked the technical rep about that option, he said getting it would still cause a Treo 600 owner's bill to be over $1,000 a month. He said it was up there for use with other phones. He had no answer when I said there are no other phones on that page.Now, I probably could return the Treo 600 - except I already sold my old phone and Palm on eBay.Of course, if I could just get a free minute for every time I heard "Oh, that's the new phone. I'm not familiar with it" none of this would be an issue.Buy the phone from AT&T;, Sprint, Cingular, or another carrier and don't deal with the problems I had with Verizon Wireless. The phone is great!

 review/summary: Cool design.
 review/text: The Nokia belt clip works like this: there's a round button about 1/4&quot; deep that snaps onto the back of the phone behind the earpiece end. This raised button clicks into a short slot in the belt clip part, which fastens securely onto your belt or pocket. Because it's round, the button-like clasp mechanism allows the phone to swivel, so it doesn't dig into your side or leg when you sit down. (At least with a 7100-series, anyway.)There's a little spring loaded button on top of the clip (the photo on Amazon is really upside-down) that disengages the round clasp and lets you pop out the phone. The design is pretty clever, and it works well. The swivel mechanism allows it to stay semi-secure even while driving. I can't speak to the durability of it, because I've only had it a week. But I like it a lot more than the standard, hard-mounted clip.

 review/summary: good phone. recommended.
 review/text: this is my first cell phone. I am quite satisfied. excellent signal (probably more because of T-mobile than the phone itself). Features are easy to learn and navigate with the accompanying manual. I quite like the camera attachment. It doesn't work well in doors (it has a low light setting which gives passable results). it's easy to position the camera len just right after using it a couple times. Of couse picture quality isn't top notch, but I never wanted to use it to take professional-looking photos. The results I got worked for me. All other features are pretty standard, and as good as any of my friends' phones that I had used. The color screen is big and clear, easy to read under strong light or in the dark. It's slightly heavier than some other phones out there.

 review/summary: Great Color Phone
 review/text: This is a really good color phone, the only thing that really keeps it from being perfect (in my opinion) is that the phone it a little slow when responding to buttons being pressed. Sometimes if the phone is &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;thinking&quot; it will take 2 or 3 seconds to respond to a button that you just pressed. This is especially noticable when browsing the Internet using T-Zones.I am using this phone on the T-Mobile network and have not experienced any dropped calls, the voice quality is very clear and the reception is good. The battery life is very good for a color phone, it lasts me about 5 days of talking just a few hours a day. Of course you can buy an extended capacity battery, and that would add much more talk time because it's about 60% more capacity.The phone looks very cool, and I like that you can change out the faceplate if you so desire. The entire keypad lights up (not just the numbers on the key) so you can see it very well in the dark. The PIM software on the phone is good, although I wish you could store addresses too. The camera attachment isn't really worth much, mostly because the quality of the pictures is pretty bad. But it's good to have if you need a quick snapshot of something and don't have any other way to capture it. Although one nice thing is, besides emailing any pictures you take with the camera, you can also save them on the phone as wallpaper images.The belt holster that comes with the phone is really nice, much better than the one that came with my old StarTAC. You can leave the clip on your belt and just detach the phone if you need to use it, then all you hacve to do is slide it back onto the belt clip. Motorola also includes a neck lanyard that attaches to the top of the phone if you want to carry it around this way, it's a nice little addition.You can store wallpaper images, screen savers, ringtones and JAVA games on this phone as well. The only other negative thing I would say about this phone is that there just isn't enough internal memory to store games. I can get two games on it, maybe three, if two of them are under 20k. There is a lot of space for wallpaper images, ringtones and phone numbers, so there's no excuse for not putting more memory for games.All in all I would recommend this phone, especially if you can get it for a low price or for free. It's a very good (but not perfect) color phone with solid features. It does have some drawbacks, but then, no phone is perfect.

 review/summary: Great case, if you only use you PDA as a phone!!
 review/text: It is a really nice case. The keyboard can not be used unless removing the phone from the case. This can't be accomplished easily. You must remove the entire apparatus from your belt, and pull the phone out. The case is so tight that when you take the phone from the case to use the keyboard, the case pulls the battery cover off. If you do not use the keybaord on a daily basis this is your case. If it is used daily, find something else. It also has plastic over the screen so to use the stylus it must be removed as well. If you are using the phone only, then get this case, otherwise, this goes in the box with the other 20 unusable cell phone cases I have aquired for this device.

 review/text: I am really happy w/ this phone. Had it for about 6 months now and like almost everything about it. Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place. A really excellent camera for a phone in this price range. I have a couple complaints about button location and the light/flash on the camera.Pros: Small, easy to use, practical menus, great camera (2MP, and it beats the pants off my wife's Nokia which also has a 2MP), good battery life and great screenCons: Light/flash for the camera is horrible. Its too bright to be a light and doesn't really function as a flash. Still, great for finding your lost keys. The buttons in the middle on the side are in a very popular position so if you don't have your phone locked, you are bound to hit these accidentally.Overall great phone and would buy it again.

 review/summary: Nokia Car Charger for Nokia Phones
 review/text: The Nokia Charger works great compared to many chargers I have used before. I previously had an analouge Motorola phone and had one of those chargers that plugged into an outlet in your house and would take all night to charge for a usage of under 8 hours. It became a real pain. So I went out and bought a Nokia 5120i and bought this charger. My phone didn't lose power for days, but when it did, I plugged in the charger and it started the job. When you plug the large end into the cigarette charger in your car, there is a little light that comes on to let you know that there is power going through the charger. Than you plug the small end into a hole in the phone. If your phone is on, you will recieve a message saying &quot;Charger Connected&quot; and than another message 5 seconds later saying &quot;Charging.&quot; Then the charger starts the job. If your phone is down to the last quarter of energy, it will take approx. 30 minutes to charge full. THATS FAST. If you have 3/4 of the energy it will take about 2-10 minutes to charge full. And the battery will continue to last for a long time. Just keep charging whenever energy is lost. I have had this phone and charger for over one year and have had no problems. One complaint of many people is that the cord is too short. Well for me its not. I have a Chrysler Concorde and the phone reaches fine. The cord will stretch between 1 to 2 1/2 feet. So that should answer your question. If you have any other questions, I recommend that you contact Nokia.

 review/text: I bought the Jabra set to use with my Nokia 5160 phone. As far as I could tell, the sound quality was acceptable, but there are two things to keep in mind:1) The plastic ear inserts not only would not fit comfortably in my ear (one hurt because it was too big, the next size down wouldn't stay in my ear). Further, the plastic inserts kept falling off the speaker!2) There are no helpful instructions to help you figure out which of the inserts are for the right and which for the left ear. You have to experiment. There isn't even instruction on how to insert them in your ear properly.

If I have time, like overnight, I put the phone in the cradle, or I just swap it with the original battery for a day. It's a little bit bigger and heavier, but all of the cases and accessories still work with it. I just don't put it in my shirt pocket with the extended battery; it's a little heavy for that.

 review/summary: The best I've used so far - excellent volume
 review/text: I've used about a half dozen after market ear pieces over the last year (most of them bought from a large nationwide discount department store), and finally decided to go with Nokia's.This one wins when it comes to volume. Every other 'cheap' aftermarket imitation I've used makes it very difficult to hear the other party while contending with highway/road noise (especially the Jabra gel hands free). With the Nokia hands free, I actually had to turn the volume down half way for one of my calls because it was too loud.Just like any other hands free piece, you will have to treat it gently (I've learned this the hard way). I don't think any of them are designed to handle abuse. Finally - I've had some after market headsets that had problems maintaining good contact with the phone. Only a few locked onto the phone and maintained contact 100% of the time. So far I haven't noticed any problems with Nokia's headset. The round ear bud might not fit everyone, and I haven't tried it on any long phone calls (yet), but it was initially very comfortable (more than the Jabra gel's I've used in the past).Overall - I am initially very pleased with it.

I've made my own ringtones from songs on my computer and just sent them to my phone using this, so now when it rings I hear the actual song. The camera is also very good with a 4x zoom and the speakerphone is great, although you can't activate it until you start talking to the person. Also has a great battery which lasts several days on standby.

The reason I am not giving it five stars - because battary life doesn't last long, the phone is a little bit haveyer than what I have excepted, the phone somehow lagging bad when you call out and receive calls.

 review/summary: Nice phone, not very sturdy
 review/text: I bought this phone about fifteen months ago and was initially very pleased. Lots of features, really cool sounding stereo sound from the stereo speakers. But.... I use my cell phone average 1500 minutes a month. The slide does not hold up. The phone sections separated on one side, I got a sim card failure message on the phone screen and the off button would not turn the phone off. Removed the battery and it is now dead on my desk, will not turn on with battery reinstalled. $300 for fifteen months is a little pricey.

 review/text: I love this case. I was looking for a long time online trying to find a black leather flip case that could hold my phone and I found this one. It's great! The only problem I had with the case originally was that the screw you use to attach the belt clip kept coming loose and falling out, but once I screwed it in as far as it would go it hasn't been a problem again. This case keeps the whole phone safe and is well worth the cost.

 review/summary: Verizon/Casio G'zone
 review/text: I was looking for a durable flip phone sans the superfluous frills which I never use. I needed something reliable with excellent "send and receive" calling quality. This unit is larger and feels sturdier than most of its genre. Its relatively bigger buttons and and overall hefty profile were the first features that caught my eye. For an indiivudal like myself with larger hands that often holds my phone in the neck-twisting, hands-free head/shoulder crunch mode, the extra size of this model is an asset. I don't have a case and keep the phone in my pants pocket. So far it has endured this manner of travel. Good bi-directional audio quality and a nice loud ring which I prefer. One drawback...forget about the reading the screen in direct sunlight. The interface is Verizon Du Jour and if you like toying with extra features there's plenty to keep you busy. Barring the screen issue this is a phone I highly recommend.

I am very happy, with this phone, have gotten one for my son, and am currently looking to buy one for my husband. I've never had a phone last 4 yrs before, I usually had them trashed before the two year contract was up. This phone I have had for 4 years and I still love it! Durable and does what I need in a phone.

 review/text: The unit works as advertised. Since I live in a rural area, I had no trouble finding unused FM frequencies. The entire FM frequency spectrum is programmable, but only three "quick pick" buttons are available. The sound is more than adequate. The iPod works best with the volume maxed out. The bass is over emphasized with "bass boost" on. I used "bass reduce" and adjusted it back with the radio controls. Treble is fine. For the price, it's an awesome unit!

 review/summary: eh...
 review/text: This is an okay product. I had been using a tape converter but something's wrong with my tape deck so I decided to try an fm converter. It's a little touchy getting used to. You have to find an fm station that's really fuzzy and not picking up things from other stations for it to work the best. My stereo doesn't allow me to go up one number at a time, it searches for the stronger signals in between, which means I can't really find the stations that would work the best. I have found some that work pretty well, but you can still hear a little static, especially between songs. I've seen a bunch of complaints that this product sucks for big cities. I noticed the same thing but figured out that if you put your antenna all the way down, this product works a lot better. It seems to have more issues on cloudy days, so if you live in a place that's cloudy a lot of the time, you may not be too happy with this device.

 review/text: I experienced the same static problems as a lot of the other viewers. Turn down the volume on your source. If you are using an ipod, turn the volume down and turn it up in your car. When the volume is maxed, you will get a ton of static. If you reduce it down to about 75% it will play just fine. Easy setup and use after the initial issue.

The Monster 300 has been working great for me for about a month now! I've noticed if I put my phone on the console or passenger seat it picks up a little static. If I put it in my lap it's clear! Give this one a try. It's worth the money.

 review/summary: Better than expected
 review/text: I was so excited when I got my first iPhone this summer; I always have it with me, and I use it all the time...except in the car because my factory stereo does not have auxiliary input. I didn't really want to spend the money on a new stereo and then have to shell out the money to get it installed, so this FM transmitter definitely came in handy. I had read many reviews on several different brands of transmitters, and it seems that people either love or hate these devices. Personally, I've had pretty good luck with mine--I have a fairly long commute, and I am able to get really good reception for most of my drive, and if I need to, it's pretty simple to find a new station, then tune my transmitter to match. The sound quality isn't crystal clear, but as long as I have my iPhone's volume turned up, I get great sound quality through my car's speakers. All in all, this transmitter has been better than what I had hoped for; I was apprehensive after reading some reviews, but I'm very glad I gave it a try. It's perfect for catching up on my podcasts during my morning and afternoon drives, and for when I feel like hearing my favorite songs. I definitely recommend this product.

 review/summary: it's ok, but not great
 review/text: I used to have an old Motorola Razor and I decided that this had a lot of new perks. Yeah, sometimes. But it's definitely not the greatest..PROS:- it looks nice; there's that pretty design on the back when you slide it open- I'm biased here but it's MUCH faster than my last razr with mp3, good message storage, etc.- good battery life!- you can charge through your computer- easy transfer to computer- camera is surprisingly clear; obviously not great, but pretty good- OK at recording videos- sounds are compromised a bit.- when you play the music, it's really clear. pretty loud, too.SO-SO:- it takes a while to get used to texting/typing on this phone. but you begin to get used to it and yes, I type faster than the phone can process but it's not too bad.- the music player is a little useless; I like to close my phone and listen to the music but if you set it like that, you can't "close ALL your applications when you close the phone."- pre-set games suck.CONS:- a little bulky compared to my razr.- the alarms: I swear they didn't go off for me more than once..and I woke up late..- sometimes, when a call goes through/I call someone, I can't hear them and they can't hear me. This gets REALLY annoying when I have to call them back. This happens at least twice a week..- I don't know if the problem is with my service or not, but my friend has tried to call me 10 times once when I had no service and my phone didn't pick up any of the missed calls except once. I don't know what's going on. But that wasn't the first time; people have tried to call me and I never get that missed call notification..All in all, it's an OK phone. I've had it for about 4 months and I don't love it because of the cons, but I'm pretty stuck with it. I also think I'm getting a little tired of Motorola.. maybe I'll go to Samsung or Nokia next time.

 review/summary: A Nice Phone
 review/text: Before this phone I had a simple no camera, flip, bulky cell phone. To go from that to this was like watching the Wizard of Oz in theatres the year it came out. My friend and I were picking out our dream phones for months and this was always on the top of my list. Finally for my birthday I got it! The camera has excellent quality, the rose color isn't a baby pink and won't be easily outgrown, and the ability to connect the phone to my computer via USB awed me for months! At that time, I was unable to text because of parental units and the costs. However, for Christmas, I received the gift of the ability to text. This is where I first found my problem. When you really get good at using the numeric keypad to text, you type pretty fast. You can tell that the letters were coming to the screen a little slower than the speed at which you text. It doesn't sound like a big problem, because it isn't, but it can be somewhat irritating and it can screw you up when you type. Similarly, the buttons do have a second delay when you open up the menu and other applications. Another problem I have found is that after sliding it all the time, you start to feel the front part become a little loose; almost like a loose tooth, kinda. One thing I was kinda dissapointed with was the music player. It wouldn't recognize any itunes files, so I couldn't download any of my itunes-bought music. But music files from CDs would open and play. A problem I have been having lately is that it keeps freezing on me when I open my contacts, but it returns within a few seconds. I can't give any advice about the IM or internet programs, but I can tell you that they are there, and from just opening the T-zones, the internet is slow. So definitly do not buy this phone thinking you will use the internet. The good applications are the voice and movie recordings because you can set your personal voice recordings as a ringtone or even more specificly, which I had fun doing, set a specialized "Caitlin's calling!" ringtone for a specific contact! Recording movies on this phone is phenomenal because you can record for up to almost half of an hour! From my experience, (and I'm not the business type), but the voice recognization program seemed to work pretty well. Taking all of this into consideration, I thought the cost was a little pricey because I didn't get a discount from a 2-year contract. (I didn't want to be locked to the phone company or plan.) The signal strength usually wasn't that great, but I'm pretty sure that it was T-mobile's fault. But when it did the quality did sound pretty nice. All in all, I love this phone and it has met my needs.

 review/text: I've had this phone for about 3 months now. It will NOT charge! I have tried many different outlets, but for the past few weeks, the phone won't charge. When it does charge, it doesn't hold a charge. I've heard of others having this problem as well. The phone is also slow. It doesn't go where you want it to go right away. The phone is awesome for a while, but then all of these problems start happening. I wouldn't buy this phone. I am going to pay the price to get a different one. I hate it.

 review/summary: Poor to Ok sound quality, connector doesn't stay in
 review/text: I bought this headset for my Nokia 6102i. It was cheap($10) so I decided to give it a try. I had a hard time fitting the connector into the phone, but I did manage to get it in. The first time I tried it, I couldn't hear anything from the headset. The second time, I made sure to press the headset connector into the phone fairly hard, and then it started working. I found that just touching the connector will disconnect it from the phoneThe sound quality is just ok. I've tried another headset using a Nokia pop-port to 2.5mm universal adapter, and that headset sounds much better.Also, when using the pop-port to 2.5mm universal adapter, my 6102i phone recognizes the headset and displays a headset icon in the middle of the phone. The 2.5mm adapter also stays connected to the phone much better than the headset. I think this head just has cheap materials and construction. (How else could they sell it for $10)I decided to return the headset and use the 2.5mm adapter instead.Summary:Pros:1) Cheap(Only $10)Cons:1) Poor or just ok sound quality2) The headset doesn't stay connected to the phone very well.

 review/text: I bought this bluetooth for my husband. He loves it and has had limited problems with it. The only issue he had was that he originally used a motorolla razer cell phone. The bluetooth had to be kept very close to the razer to work. If he moved a foot or more away there was a lot of scratching noise, even if the phone was just in his pocket. He now owns a Tmobile Dash and it works great with the new phone. He can go up to about 30ft away with no problems.

 review/summary: Does what its supposed to do for a bargain price
 review/text: There isn't much to say about this BT handsfree headset. It is simple, has good battery life and the cradle is very handy...I only use this in my car (because of the new handsfree law) and it sits there turned on all the time. When I get in the car, I just tap the button on the headset and it re-initializes with my iphone and it is ready to go.It is comfortable enough for me since I only keep it in my ear during a call, but if you are planning to keep it in your ear all the time you might want to look into something smaller. I have no regrets with this purchase especially with the cost being around $35. The voice quality is not the greatest but I didn't have a problem with it either, the loudness makes up for it.BTW The car cradle was one of the biggest selling points for me...

 review/summary: Good Performer - Top of the Middle Range
 review/text: Although the Plantronics Explorer 350 is my first bluetooth device, my cousin has an Explorer 330. The 350 is substantially better - less strange, garbled background swirling noise while driving at highway speeds. Both tend to transmit that strange noise if the pavement is rough under the tires or if the car cabin is noisy. We both got these devices to use in the car, and they serve their purpose admirably. When the phone rings, you can easily put the device in your ear and answer the call - no fumbling with dangling, tangled wires, and you can keep your attention on the road where it belongs. The 350 comes with both a car charger and home charger. Note that you're not supposed to use the 350 while it is charging. And note that the home charger doesn't plug into the wall; it plugs into a USB port, which means you charge it from your laptop or desktop PC. I got the 350 because I wanted one with a car charger, but now I wish I had gotten the Plantronics Voyager 510. The charge holds plenty long on the 350 (about 3 weeks now using it intermittently), and if the 510 holds its charge that long, then it would suit me better. Its noise cancellation feature would hopefully eliminate that strange background swirling noise that the 350 sometimes transmits to your listener. Besides, you could use the 510 on your home or office phone, too. Having said that, the 350 works pretty well. Once you situate it correctly in your ear, you can hear your caller just fine. The voice-activated feature works great with my voice-activated phone. Again, I don't have to look at the phone to make a voice-activated call. Works great for the car, and I'm using it more and more around the house. I like not having to hold the phone to my ear.Plantronics Explorer 350 Easy-To-Use Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones

 review/text: The item arrived broken. Had to returned it for a refund. The item came with a mounting bracket, car charger, and a USB charging unit. The charging port on the headset looks to be a proprietary connection; at least, I've never seen a charging port like it on any device other than Plantronics devices. I would recommend getting a device with a standardized charging port (like microUSB) instead.

 review/summary: LG HBM-500. cute, but not so good
 review/text: I was surprised by all the problems I had with this headset. I talked to several people who said they can barely make out what I am saying. I was not even in a noisey environment. SO I decided to call and leave messages on my home and my work phones using the headset. The messages were barely audible. Not good.While I like the LED display, this headset often does not connect with the phone when I turn it on. Also I would be in the middle of a call with the cell phone cliped to my belt and the headset would read "Out of Range" and just drop the call.The fit on the Hbm500 is very poor - it fell off several times. The only thing I liked was that it can be put on either ear.

 review/summary: Good case, clip maybe not so much
 review/text: I got this in mid-2003, so it may have changed since then. The clip it came with (as I recall) was rather large and angular; if you wear something on your belt, you don't want too many hard edges when you bend over! I purchased the V60 case sold by Verizon, which came with a more rounded clip - but continued to use the Body Glove case because the neoprene appeared to offer more protection than thin leather. It has held up pretty well. After 3 years the back and mesh that fits around the top half of the phone have started to tear, but still usable. The failure point was finally the grommet that snaps into the clip: it broke in half and came loose from the case fabric. Still, decent life considering I wear the phone every day, everywhere. I just removed the case to replace it, and the phone still looks new underneath. I have dropped it more times than I would like, and I'm sure the case has protected it cosmetically, and probably functionally as well. Would buy again, but I still have that Verizon case so I'm using that now.

 review/text: I've had this stylus for about four weeks now, and although i love the idea of a stylus and in fact am using it now, this one is starting to show wear. The 'plug' that allows you to attach it to the headphone port has partially broken, so it won't stay put when i plug it in, and the tip is cracking in places. It does its job, but I'm beginning to wonder how LONG it will keep doing its job.

 review/summary: Wonderful phone with a couple of problems
 review/text: The T610 is relatively small, which personally I love, and it's loud, which is awesome when you misplace it like I do everything. I adore this phone, but I have two major issues with it. First of all, the camera is not all that great. Unless there is a LOT of light, you won't be able to take any good pictures. Second, if it's really sunny out, you will barely be able to see the screen. It gets annoying sometimes. Otherwise, this phone is pretty useful. The interface is easy to learn, and (my fave) the text messaging feature is also useful and convenient (except for the T9 thing-- you might wanna shut that off real quick). I get a very strong signal almost everywhere, except when I'm surrounded by cornfields in the middle of nowhere (understandable), and the sound quality is very good. If you find a good deal on this phone, take it.

 review/text: I've had this phone for several months now, and it has incredible battery life, even with running Bluetooth almost constantly both my laptop and the Jabra hands free unit. The unit is also solid, as I can say I have dropped it a couple of times on a hard floor and have had little more than a scuff on the case. I am very impressed with the GSM reception despite the lack of an external antenna. The screen is bright and easy to read and this is a great phone for connectivity with a laptop and to the internet. Audio quality is awesome too. I have no complaint for this phone, and at the price, it really can't be beat.

 review/summary: Pretty good......not great!
 review/text: If you are looking for a really good phone, and don't care about the bells and the whistles, then I would say this is the phone for you. My cell phone is my life line to my business, so having a long battery life is one of if not the best feature of this phone.The design is fabulous. It is very durable, but a little on the small and light side (I guess which is a plus). I have dropped this so many times, and it still works like I just got it yesterday. The key pad is easy to navigate without looking, as is the menu.It is super easy retreiving missed calls, or calling back missed calls. Phone also offers name announcements, which you pre-record, as well as assigning special ring tones for different callers. Vibrate feature comes in handy.....it vibrates just enough that you can hear it without it disturbing or interfering what is going on around you at the office.The minor faults of this phone if you really care about these features are: camera is absolutely horrible; buttons on the sides are badly placed....always found myself pressing one of them when picking up the phone...maybe they were just too sensitive; signal is not as good and receptive as others; and NO SPEAKERPHONE - just bluetooth so you can go out and spend more money on an annoying earpiece.Overall, I must say it truly is a good phone. The only reason I am in the market for a new one is because my state has banned hand held cell phone use while driving, and I can't stand the ear pieces. If this phone had the speakerphone capability built in, I would stick with it and continue being happy.

I think I was wrong in doing that.The Sprint service was working fine. My Sony Ericsson phone does not have any reception at all in my office & has a Lousy reception at home as well!!!!!!!!!!T Mobile sent me a replacement Phone & as well as the SIm card in the hope that their service would improve. Unfortunately (to my horror & utter dis-belief) the service is no better. The service is fine after I checked the SIm on my friend's phone which is a NOKIA. T Mobile refuses to replace the phone with the same features...I will have to shell a good amount of money as well....All in all SOny Ericsson T610 is not a good one. At best I can say that it is a good one by itself..but not for T Mobile I guess.

 review/text: The phone itself is fantastic, full color, pictures, voice dialing, voice recorder, themes, etc. The only complaint I have is that in order to connect to the internet you have to turn the phone off and on again just before connecting. This is because the phone requires a &quot;fresh&quot; signal or will not connect (this info came stright from T-Mobile). Not a major problem, but tedious nonetheless.I still rate it at a 4 (outside of the interent issue it is a 5)

 review/summary: Disappointed T610 owner
 review/text: I just bought the T610 and have been disapointed so far. The charging circuit in the phone doesn't work properly (never confirms that the battery is fully charged, even after 8+ hours of charging.) But more important, the phone's reception is very poor! I live in the Seattle area. Once in a brief while, I show all 5 bars on the display, but more often it's only 2 or 3, and a weak 2 or 3 at that. My wife bought the Samsung E105 at the same time. The side-by-side comparison is very interesting. Her phone shows 5 bars (and gets great reception) most of the time; we're both on T-Mobile. I bought the T610 primarily because I wanted Bluetooth, but it's not worth it. My recommendation - steer clear of the T610. If you buy it, I think you'll be disappointed too.

 review/text: After using about a dozen cell phones in the past 5 years I have found a phone I love to use. I get great reception (but it may be from switching from ATT Wireless to TMobile) and love the color display. My only two negatives about the phone is the keypad is a little small for my fat fingers (you should see me type on a full -size keyboard!). The other downside is the address book is a little hard to navigate (but that might be a learning curve on my part). I would feel very comfortable recommending this phone to a friend.

 review/summary: Not a bad phone Plus Phone card use.
 review/text: First off take any bad reviews here with a grain of salt, All of the this phone is garbage reviews on here almost detered me from buying this phone. And what a difference when it comes to connectivity with this phone over my S105. One thing I do give the S105 is it does seem like it has better all around sound more on par with a regular home phone where as the T610 sounds a bit shallow to me, but thats all just prefrence and it is very clear. Back to being able to connect up over bluetooth to your PC and file sharing between the PC and the T610. Set it up and all works good. My S105 just wasnt up to snuff when it came to connecting to a pc (nothing but trouble). Anyways at this point I recommend this phone although I guess we will see how well it holds up.A.Z.I just received this phone as well and reading your view I hadnt tried my phone card input as well so I tried, Had no trouble at all entering a 12 digit code. Worked fine first time. I tend to think you either have a bad phone or your service is going in and out.Revision 1:I will take back the reception being better than my samsung S105 at this point as well. This phone has dropped on me the last 2 days of use in places that my S105 did not. In fact my S105 didnt drop hardly ever. Im kind of in the middle of the road on this phone now. Love the features of it but the sound and reception quality could be better Im feeling now.Revision 2.After having this phone for about 2 weeks now there is nothing really wrong with this phone other than I dont care for the sound on my end of the line. People I have called say this phone sounds better than the samsung S105 I had before it. The bluetooth and easy connection to the phone to my computer is a big plus for this phone. Samsung I had was not worth the time when it came to this. Not a bad phone for +175!

 review/summary: T610 Good Phone with Quirks
 review/text: I have a T610 with T-Mobile here in South Florida, The 1st phone I got had the Freeze for no reason problem 3x in 3 weeks. It also failed to charge on at least 1 occasion. I returned the phone and got another one and it has been great. Reception is hit and miss in building (good ole faraday effect). The camera is nice but all I use it for is a pic of my cat at this time. Sound quality is good on calls but the Increasing ring is annoying because it doesn't disable even when you set it to off. Screen quality is good but don't bother trying in direct sunlight. The only problem I have is finding a good game for the phone. Anybody know a good morphun game site for this phone? T-Mobile doesn't have any apps available.

 review/summary: t610 user
 review/text: I have owned this T610 for almost 6 months now. Initially I was impressed by its sleek look and colorful features. But as I got acquainted with its functions, I wasn't so glad anymore. This phone has serious technological flaws. It would change my time zone anytime even when I wasn't traveling to a different time zone. At one time my battery would show almost half life and then within 20 mins it would give me a "low battery alert" - that too when I had hardly used the phone for 3 months. My voice messages would reach me after a few hours (at times next day!). There would be 3 signal bars and then too I would have problems listening to someone who was talking form a land line. At times the phone would just freeze (like Windows products!!) and I would have to restart the phone.I explained these problems to T-Mobile and they promptly replaced my old T610 with a new T610. But the problems persist - esp. the battery and freezing problems.This is the first time I am using a Sony Ericsson and believe me it's the last time too. I have used Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and LG phones earlier and I never ever had such technological problems with the phone instrument.As for T-Mobile service, its awesome. I would strongly recommend T-Mobile only if you were not to use this T610 instrument.

 review/summary: Great phone; needs a better screen
 review/text: I've had this phone for just over three months, and I'm pretty happy with it. The phone's features have been discussed here and elsewhere in great details, and I won't spend too much time talking about them. It hasn't frozen on me once, and performed well overall. I would have given T610 5 stars if not for the following:1. Screen is barely usable in bright light. Scratch that. It is not usable in bright light at all!2. Synch. software bundled with the phone screwed up my Outlook installation: messages stopped arriving automatically, and I had to check for new messages manually. I am now using generic Bluetooth synchronization service, which unfortunately only works with contacts.3. Battery life could be better. It's not bad - the phone lasts a couple of days of occasional use with Bluetooth always on, but it could be better. Your mileage may vary though, because battery life does depend on signal strength, and T-Mobile coverage in my house is pretty bad.I have found quality of the images produced by the phone camera to be so poor that I can't even imagine any use for the camera itself. I didn't expect it to be any good, so I suppose it &quot;met expectations.&quot;Other notes: Jabra BT-200 headset works great with this phone. Voice dialing works reasonably well, especially with longer labels. For example, I couldn't get it to recognize 'dad', while 'father' worked fine. I never thought I would like the ability to change themes, but I do! Be sure to visit myt610.net for a great selection of free themes, rings, games, and more.Again, I'm pretty happy with the phone overall.

 review/summary: worst phone ever
 review/text: I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it. It looks snazzy but its a big overpriced toy that I really regret buying. I'm seeking to replace this phone ASAP.Just how bad is this phone?This phone is SO SO bad I'm compelled to write about it because I am that furious. This is my first and most likely last review as I don't usually like to waste my time writing these. HOWEVER, I really wish to warn people against this phone. It is THE WORST phone I have ever owned. The battery life is very short compared to any other phone I have ever owned. My second complaint is that I lose signal very suddenly, going from having a full spectrum of reception to zilch. My third complaint is that I get dropped from calls quite frequently, once was during a job interview inquiry. My friends all have reception in areas with the same T-mobile service but different phones. I HIGHLY discourage anyone from getting this phone.There are two redeeming features about this phone, both of which are trivial compared to its many many serious problems. One is that its screen is so bright it is a good flashlight at night. The platform game is pretty entertaining and itis the only reason I would give this phone one star.Oh I also forgot to mention that the phone ring tones ascend from low volume to a greater volume over time. A very annoying feature.

 review/summary: Phone is problematic
 review/text: I've had the T610 for 4 days now and I feel that I've learned enough about the phone to write my own review. I think it's a great phone and there are already many reviews highlighting its features so I won't go over those.Instead, I'm going to write what I don't like about the phone.- It's a small phone, even compared to my Motorola V66. Because it's not a flip phone, it's hard to listen and talk at the same time. Yes I hold the earpierce to my ear, but I find it so much more comfortable and clear with my old flip phone.- Since there are so many features, it takes some navigating to get to what you want.- The reception actually has not been bad. The reception fluctuates from 2 to 4 bars where my V66 maintains a constant 5, but the phone still gets reception. Compared to my roommates T616, which is the ATT's equivalent of the T610, he gets no reception at all where I can get 2 bars.- no speakerphone- the headset that came with the phone was broken, but i can get it replaced- The biggest GRIPE I have about the phone is that it restarts by itself in the middle of my phone calls! It's happened many times already in the 4 days I've had it. I called CS and I was told to do a 'Master Reset' but still did not help, so it is not a software issue. When I opened the backcover to check the battery and immediately the battery fell out! Perhaps it is the design of the phone but when I told Tmobile this, they said they're going to send me another one because that should not happen. I read alot of reviews for the Nokia 3650 and the T610 before I made my purchase, and the reason I didn't go for the 3650 is because I read that it restarts itself for no reason, and now it's happening to me with the T610!It's probably just bad luck that this is happening to my phone but If I had the choice to pick a new phone, I don't think I would go for the T610 again. The features are great and it looks sleek but I would go for a flip phone for its small size without the compromise of voice volume and clarity.Hope this helped.

 review/summary: Great design/many features but not the best camera phone
 review/text: Trust me this phone overall has a great design and many features but some things I dislike about it.LIKES: Bluetooth support, creative design, small size, many features such as voice commands, code memos (to remeber your passwords for credit cards etc..), note pad, picture ids, and recorder to record conversations(to catch someone in a lie!), ringer/picture downloads, long battery life.DISLIKES:1.Camera: pics are dull; i dont even bother to use it anymore. If looking for a good camera phone this isnt the one!2. Display: hard to see in bright lights outdoors and gets smudged easily3. Buttons: are too small especially the 4 black buttons and middle joystick,you can easily press wrong button and delete something or exit a menu by accident, also have to keep keypad locked, you have to really get use to using the buttons.4. Vibrator: you can easily miss calls because it vibrates so light, you may not even feel it. However, this can also be good since some phones vibrate so loud that everyone knows it's your phone!! (might as well kept it on to ring right??)5. No speakerphone: would have been great for handsfree use.6. The Call list: all the incoming, outgoing, and missed calls are listed in one menu; this is so unorganized to me and can be confusing; you have to look at the symbols to determine what kind of call it was. Also for calls more than a day old it doesnt show the time; only shows date and phone number. I think this is important to me, especially if you recieve a lot of business calls, because on machines like caller ids and voicemail they tell you the time not just the date. You also have wait for the display of text to flash to see all info because it can't be shown on several display lines.7. Phonebook: you can't see all info at one once; you also have to wait till display flashes to see both name and number. This can be time consuming.8. Text Messaging: writing a text message can be cumbersome. The T9 text input is somewhat confusing on this phone. You can easily exit the message and have to write it all over again!9. Menu Access: On some menus you have to execute a lot of un-necessary keystrokes and some even take time to pop up such as when downloading; As stated before this can be frustrating and time consuming.***I just had to add to this review today on Nov. 12, 2003*** that since I bought the phone on Nov.1, I have really experienced more horrible things about this phone.....sometimes when I am on a call and then try to disconnect the call, the phone sometimes freezes (crashes) and is reluctant to hang up!! This is similar to what happens to your PC when it freezes!! When this happens I have to turn the power completely off. I sure don't want to deal with the freezing problem with my PC AND a cell phone! As you might imagine this occurrence will continue to use up your minutes because it doesn't hang up call. I notice this happens especially when using touch tones when accessing automated systems such as voicemail and banking menus.I am in the process of returning this phone and purchasing a Samsung flip phone instead. The more I use the phone the more I find disturbing things about it.

 review/summary: Don't take out your battery without turning off the phone
 review/text: Considering that I had a T68i before T610 so this T610 phone is actually much faster and better in many different ways. Unfortunately it freezes up on me at least once a month now. It happened after I took out the battery without turning off the phone one time. Sometimes when I dial all I hear is, "The number you have dialed is not in service" and at that time I really thought the person I called has disconnected his phone, but until I started calling other people and that was all I would hear, then I knew it was my phone or my T-mobile service. I couldn't do anything but to turn the phone off and turn it back on in order to dial out again.

 review/summary: Sony Ericsson T610: great design, bad reception.
 review/text: First of all, I've used Sony Ericsson T610 with both Cingular and T-Mobile service and found them comparable in Los Angeles (Verizon is best here). From comparing all three phones (Nokia 6230, Sony Ericsson T610, and Motorola V551) with Cingular service, I've discovered that there is a *BIG* difference in phone reception quality.Phone reception quality is as follows: Nokia 6230 > Motorola V551 >> Sony Ericsson T610. The Sony Ericsson T610 had no reception in my apartment, the Nokia 6230 has great reception everywhere.Overall phone quality: Nokia 6230 > Sony Ericsson T610 >> Motorola V551. (Though if reception is most important, you might rank Motorola V551 over SE T610.)Here are pros/cons of Sony Ericsson T610:PROS:-Bluetooth: easy to sync contacts, photos, etc. w/PC, no additional software required => great.-Great battery life-Great display resolution, better than Nokia 6230.-Nice OS design: easy to navigate, easy to read menus, ex. "silent" is handy-Small, sleek, cool-looking, phoneCONS:-Bad reception!-Phone freezes sometimes. If turning on/off doesn't fix, try removing (and then re-inserting :) battery.-Sometimes keylock doesn't work and phone calls contacts.I recommend this phone if you have a good service provider for your area. It is cheap and easy to use. (Though, be wary of service providers locking the bluetooth. This hasn't happened to anyone I know, but I've heard that it's been a problem.) If I had reception in my apartment, I would have kept the T610 and sold the new Nokia 6230 on ebay.

 review/summary: Can't do better for the plus 200 in rebates
 review/text: (...)Using the app, I was able to upload/download ringtones, themes, backup my address book, delete unwanted files on the phone, etc, straight from my computer keyboard, without having to touch all those tiny buttons on the phone. I'm 6'4", and those tiny phone buttons are a pain for me sometimes, but I'll live with it, as the rebates are giving me free phone service for 5 months. Plus, T-mobile will let get you the 1000 minute plan for 40 bucks, how cool is that? Pretty good, you don't get rollover yet, but I'm sure they'll get something comparible to Cingular soon. Like all cell phones, your reception is dependent on the phone and the towers in your area. I have only one bar reception at my house, and I'm able to have decent converations all the time with only a few dropouts. I recommend this phone and service.

 review/summary: a great phone if it wasn't for the weak-link joystick
 review/text: This was my second Sony-Ericsson phone (the first was a T68i), and the fatal flaw in both phones was poor joystick design. In both cases, after about a year and a half of light to normal use, the joystick started to work erratically. Movement either did not register, or registered as 'Enter' rather than movement. Since you cannot do anything on this phone without using the joystick, it becomes difficult to perform basic actions, such as locating and calling a contact. It also means that I frequently make and have to quickly cancel multiple accidental calls due to unintended input before I make it to the intended number in the contact list. I will never again purchase a cell phone that has a joystick.Other than this one (very major) problem, this phone has served me well. Bluetooth synchronization is handled flawlessly by iSync on my Mac (at least for contact information; I never tried the calendar), and I was also able to used the phone as a modem, connecting my Powerbook to the internet wherever I had cell service. The form factor is just about perfect; the phone is unobtrusive in a pocket, and it is easy to hold. The side volume buttons are a great touch. I give it three stars because it was exactly what I wanted and worked well until the joystick started malfunctioning.

 review/summary: horrible experience with T610 and T-mobile
 review/text: When the phone came it didn't recognize the SIM card. I called t-mobile, one woman told me the SIM card was locked and that they need to file a form to request the unlock code. I needed to wait for 24 hours to get it. She didn't know why it was locked!The next day I received an email saying that I am not eligible to have the unlock code yet because any account should be activated 90 days before they can have an unlocked code! How rediculous this sounds! I called them again, a man told me he had to file another form, basically just another request for the unlock code and a waive for the 90 day period. I needed to wait for another 24 hours. I asked if I can go to a local store and have it checked, he told me NO!The day after that I received another email, which was exactly the same as what I've got the last time! Not a sigle word was different. I called them the third time, a woman finally said &quot;sorry&quot; to me, and said I can go to a local store and have a new SIM card.Finally the phone worked after I got to the local store. Then a week after I used it, the phone died out of nothing. It was sitting on the table when I picked it up and found it was not responding to anything. I called t-mobile again, a guy didn't say sorry or anything, he said they will mail me another one within 5 days. He was about to say good-bye before I asked him &quot;so I have no phone to use before I get the new&quot;, he said oh, you can go to a local store and have a loan phone or something. The guy sounded like a dead person talking I was so sick of listening to him.Well, now I am waiting. I hope you good luck on this phone and T mobile. They all made me so sick.

 review/summary: Overrated Phone - don't let its good looks hook you!
 review/text: After a month of use on this phone I have enough input to rate it. I am on the T-mobile network. I have owned Nokia 5160, 6162, and 8265.First the positives :)1. Very stylish2. Camera function3. Attaches pictures to call contacts4. Decent graphics and colors5. Blue tooth6. Black Jack game - sonyericsson.com7. Good polyphonic sound8. Reliable - Hasn't crashed or got stuck9. Small- not a bother to carry aroundNegatives :(1. Piss poor reception at times, my other phone got better reception- May be t-mobile2. The novelty of a camera on a phone has worn off and the pictures are fuzzier than a truck driver's back.3. Battery easily drained - 48 hours without charging and you're dead..er it's dead4. Slow loading t-zones5. Not user friendly6. Takes a long time to do anything esp. write sms7. Calculator is limited8. Buttons are so close together it strains your fingers and you will make many keypad mistakes - Also hard to write messages9. Scrolls slowly; hard to go through call contacts and doesn't go to second letter in contact list10. Hard to hold in your hand esp. with long calls- small11. Scratches easily and the screen gets so dirtyHope this helps. That's all I can think about right now. I am used to Nokia but the idea of a camera phone made me curious and the 3650 was too large. Nokia 6600 camera phone with camera will be out soon. I'd give it 2.5 stars right in the middle but there was none, so I went down. Don't buy this novelty phone if you log a lot of minutes!

 review/text: I bought this product because it has USB to connect to your computer. If you use this handfree with cell phone it works perfect, but when you connect it through USB it takes many cpu cycles, making my computer slow during voice chat. I noticed this behavior while using Skype. Other than that, it installed automatically on my Vista box, without any drivers.

 review/summary: Great item
 review/text: I will have to admit, this is my first headset to own and use. I researched a lot to find a headset that would be comfortable on my ear and have quality audio on both sides of the conversation. The Voyager 510 has all of this. It is however larger than most, if not all of the bluetooth headsets out on the current market. So if you don't mind a little larger headset, this is a great buy. It has great battery life and has a large radius to reach your bluetooth device. It currently works seamlessly with both my computer and Razer cell phone. To keep it protected, I got an old Altoids metal box, padded the inside, and I keep my headset in there when I am mobile.

 review/summary: Barely worth the goldbox price
 review/text: I bought this on a gold box special for $17.99. And that's BARELY what it is worth. It is not like the wonderful description. I can't put my phone in my pocket or it doesn't work, constantly breaking up and muffled. The phone has to be fairly close(a foot or so) to the bluetooth or the voice breaks up. I am totally disappointed with it. I had previously owned two motorola bluetooth devices, and they were far superior to this. I lost the last one in a house fire and was trying to replace it. Poor choice. It is much larger and not as comfortable and stable as the old one. The regular price on this is about the same as I paid for the other(the motorola), and the quality is far below. I was going to return it, but there is no return choice that lists poor quality as a reason.

 review/text: This little earpiece is amazing. The sound quality is very impressive. Teh fit in the ear canal helps block out so much sound that it can actually be difficult to hear someone if you are NOT using the phone!It weighs next to nothing and the sound quality on theother end, I'm told, is as good as if I wasn't using my headset at all.Very affordable, very comfortable, great sound quality. The only downside is the batter life is short. Make sure you have your charger with you - it doesnt' take long to recharge it, but you will have to charge it more often than you expect.

The only problems are that it's a bit bulky and the price of course is EXCESSIVE. If I wasn't able to get it for $40, I wouldn't have been able to get this great phone.

 review/summary: The Sony Ericsson is an excellent cell phone
 review/text: My #1 complaint with the Sony Ericsson S710a would be some of the reviewers. One reviewer stated something like, " it was annoying having to open the S710a to take a picture", guess they didn't read the manual. Someone stated, "small keys", I have big hands and had no problem with the recessed keys. This was a good one, "the hands free ear piece was to loud" well there's volume control buttons. By the way they never mentioned the little chrome button on the mouthpiece of the hands free that you press to answer or press to hang-up.I have also heard complaints about the swivel opening of the S710a. I do feel this swivel style is much stronger than a hinged flip style since there is a much larger bearing surface allowing less of a chance of cracked and broken hinges as I've seen on other hinged portable equipment.Although I haven't checked battery talk time I know I get at least 4 hours and it takes about 1 hours to recharge.I don't consider the S710a big and bulky for what it has and that is an excellent camera. Without reading the camera instructions I found it easy to use to take pics of my daughter in her Halloween costume.I was pleasantly surprised to find I could read the display and number buttons without glasses. The display is bright and sharp, as a matter of fact at times I use the brightness of the display as a flashlight at night walking on my unlit driveway (there is also a camera light).Sound quality is crisp and clear even when Cingular reception isn't the best. If you don't want to hold the phone next to your ear the speakerphone has excellent clarity.All I wanted was a good phone and I got a lot more. I bought a second for my daughter's mother so she can capture all those things I taught my daughter to annoy Mommy, Auntie P and Grandma..

 review/summary: There are better phones out there
 review/text: I bought my first Cherry Chocolate in December 2006. Today June 13, I received my recplacement chocolate in the mail. The phone is very easy to get used to. Honestly, I don't know how any phone can be too confusing.The pictures are great. I bought a ringtone ($2.99 is pricy, T-Moble charged me $1.99 for the past 3 years) and a game. I really do hate that Verizon Wireless phones do not come with default games.After 2-3 months, my cancel button stopped working. I'd come back if I didn't close the phone, but then eventually it completely stopped working. Like another reviewer, it would constantly call the last person on my call log. It can be so sensitive, but yet not sensitive enough for the cancel button (sensor pad) to work.I would be typing a text message and before I could even finish one sentence, it would automatically send. Sometimes, it would scroll down the menus non stop until I just closed it. It would also freeze while I would do something, so I would have to close the phone and open it up again.The music player was great. You really need a memory card to get the total use of this "MP3 player/cellphone"I get my new phone in the mail today and one of the screws on the back of the phone (where the battery goes) was missing. The factory sent me a phone that was either NOT inspected, or had a terrible inspection job. I understand it's just a screw, but that's just plain lazy.Also, the pictures I have saved on my card do not cover the entire wallpaper like on my old phone. I do not understand this.If you have a lot of money to spend, I guess this is a good phone for you. You can buy V-Cast and download all their extra stuff. If you have a lot of money and want to use it wisely, I suggest going to T-Moble and purchasing a Blackberry or any other phone.

 review/summary: Not Worth It!
 review/text: I bought this case because it was cheap and it looked good, but it was a big mistake. The case is way to big leaving the iPod room to slide around, and it is VERY hard to open. There is alos a huge hinge on the bottom of the case which makes it look very unappealing. There is also no protection for the wheel.The only think that I can say in favor of this case is that it does do a fair job of protecting the ipod and the screen.

 review/summary: Awkward
 review/text: I bought this case because the plastic one that came with it originally cracked and wouldn't hold the phone securely. But when I read the reviews of the replacement case, they were not good. I will probably go back to the original style again.The major problem for me is that this case design makes the phone stick out from my belt significantly. It catches on things. And for some reason the phone flips open frequently. The second thing I dislike about it is that moisture seems to collect between the clear plastic windows and the phone ... no I don't swim with it ... I have no idea where this wetness comes from.The good thing ... it looks OK and is what is advertised, which is more than you can say for a lot of stuff these days!

 review/text: I have to agree with a few people on here about being a little worried. I expected the phone to start on fire or blow up for the price I paid. I decided for the price it's worth the risk. I was right. This battery lasted longer than the original one I had and for a fraction of the price. This was one of the best purchases anyone can make if they have a razor. If you have a good battery you might want to by a couple for long trips without recharging. Two thumbs way up I don't know how they do it with that price but they did!

 review/summary: Ok for replacement batteries
 review/text: I purchased two replacement batteries from SFPlanet because another user highly recommended them. While I am satisfied with the two replacement batteries, they look new and both are in working order, it took over a week to receive my shipment and I chose "expedited shipping" which to this day, I have yet to understand what "expedited" must mean to SFPlanet if that means their shipments end up taking over a week. I think if I chose the regular, free shipping through Amazon, the product would have come quicker than it did by paying extra for expedited. I really like my Motorola V3 razor but I am tired of buying replacement batteries (seems like we are up to every 6 months now) and "taking a chance" on companies I'm not comfortable with, throwing money down the drain, etc. Considering it is my ONLY phone, it is a major inconvenience. I think when these two replacement batteries are up, it will be time to replace the phone and it won't be with a Motorola. They seem to have awfully short battery lives and I don't hear a lot of other people having the same problem with other brands of phones.

 review/text: I do love it. The only problem I have is the same as others, the ear piece is alittle difficult to stay in my ear but I do get it to stay on. That is why I gave it only 4 stars. People tell me they can't even tell that I am using a bluetooth & the sound quality for me is excellent. It is so easy to use, turning on/off/answering a call. I do recommend this one.

 review/summary: Adorable, but doesn't fit well
 review/text: I bought this to pair with my iPhone and it has been extremely easy to use. My one complaint is that (like others have said) it doesn't fit my ear well, and it's extremely hard to wear if you are wearing sunglasses.But it is so cute, and I make it work. I only wear it in the car, but I would imagine it's a little difficult if you are trying to walk/run anywhere.

 review/text: This the first Bluetooth product I've purchased, and I love it - sound is so clear, it's like being in the same room with the person you're talking to. The earpiece is a little uncomfortable, but I can live with that since I can hear people on my cell phone now! This product was also very easy to set up with my cell phone too. What will they think of next?

 review/summary: Great Phone!
 review/text: I recently upgraded my phone to an LG CU500. I am very pleased. Here's why:This is a very attractive phone. It looks similar to the RAZR, but it does not have the same wide body. (I do not care for the wide body of the RAZR, it makes it hard to fit in pockets.) I also like the slim body. It is slim enough, but it still feels sturdy. The phone is black with chrome around the external display and the external music controls. When you flip open the phone, you see a great, bold colored screen. You can customize BOTH screens with wallpapers and how you want to display the date and time.The reception is great. I can hear crisp and clear, and for those other phones that you've had that just don't get loud enough when you're talking, the highest talk volume (7) on this phone is plenty loud enough, I have to keep it on 5 so I won't go deaf. I didn't think the reception would be so clear because of the internal antenna, but it is as clear as it could be.The buttons on the phone are raised above the surface, unlike many other slim phones, such as the RAZR, the KRZR, or some of Samsung's slim phones. Under the external display are the music buttons. Which are Rewind/Back, Play/Pause, and Forward/Next. On the left side of the phone are two buttons, the rocker and the task button. If the phone is closed you can punch the task button and you can go to the MP3 player, take a photo, or record a video. If the phone is open and you hit the task button, you get the "Task Menu" which brings you to all the available tasks. (MEdia Net Home, Music Player, Games, Applications, Call, Write Message, Message Box, IM)The phone has a 1.3 mega pixel camera, which is capable of video too. It takes clear, crisp photos and can zoom. The camera lens can rotate 180 degrees to take a self portrait, or to take one of someone else. Each time you rotate the lens, the display is upside down, so you hit the rocker button to flip it right side up.If you hit the right soft key, the phone pulls up My Menu. This menu is extremely convenient. You make this menu, adding the items you want.I have not tried the MP3 player yet because you have to buy a separate USB cable that hooks up through the charger port of the phone. You can add memory to the CU500 with micro SD cards.The ringtones are loud and get attention. There are only a few that I really like, but the rest are OK. The ringtones are ascending, so it starts out average volume and increases to loud, and there is no option to change it, but it's not a big problem for me.This phone is also 3G capable, which means it can get Cingular's fastest internet speeds.I highly recommend that you get this phone. It is the best phone out right now. I don't think they will come out with a phone better than the LG CU500 soon.[...]

 review/summary: great phone for awhile...problems now
 review/text: I got a LG CU500 about 6 months ago from Amazon. The phone worked great and suited my needs, but it started going haywire a couple of weeks ago. For some reason, the phone would call the last person I talked to while it was closed and in my pocket. This is a flip phone and there are no buttons on the side or front of the phone that allow you to place calls, so it was not a case of me accidentally pressing on one of the buttons in my pocket. I just took the phone to my local AT&T store, and they showed me that barely touching the headphone jack on the side of the phone brings up the recent calls menu and dials my last call. The people at AT&T informed me that I am not the first person they have seen with this problem and the only way I can get it fixed is for AT&T to send me a replacement phone. This has been a very annoying problem and I am glad I am getting a new phone.

 review/summary: The best BT headset I have used yet...
 review/text: I am new to all of this Bluetooth stuff so I really wasn't sure which one to try out first.I decided to buy 3 different headsets and return the ones I did not like.The first headset I tried was the Jabra BT350. The sound was great if you retro fitted one of the Jabra gel earpieces on, but after an hour or so the ear gel was hurting my ear. It also did not fit around my ear very well. I kept feeling like the headset was going to fall off.The second headset I tried was the Motorola H500. I hated this headset. It felt very loose on my ear and the sound quality was horrible.Lastly I tried the Motorola HS850 and love it. It fits my ear great and the sound quality is great. I have read a lot of reviews stating that the headset is not loud enough. I thought this too at first but once I turned the volume on the headset up, it was great.So far, this is the best headset that I have tried. I was going to try the Jabra XJ10, but I can't see spending the money on it when the HS850 works just fine for me.

 review/text: The literature on the manufacturer's website (Spark Technology) implies that the CellStik can be updated to be compatible with new models by simply downloading software to "upgrade" the "stick". I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband for Christmas. He has the Samsung A820 model and, as I write this, we have not been able to get updated software to make this compatible with my husband's cellular phone. So, this is a good theory--upgrade your phone and easily transfer information--but it is NOT a good product. I am truly disappointed.

 review/text: I bought this package mainly for the charger. Even if the rest was bad, the charger would well be worth the $ I paid. The charger works great. The earbud works fairly well. The sound quality on both ends is perfect but it is difficult to keep in your ear. The clip works well if you can find a way to attach it to your car and brace it. To use the clip, you have to attach a button to the back of your phone which is included. Once you attach it, it cannot be removed and reattached. It adds to the size of your phone but holds well.

 review/text: This does not have a swivelling belt clip. I've read the other reviews in which some reviewers try to correct some of the buyers who've complained of this. These reviewers have essentially told the complainers they aren't trying hard enough and the clips really do swivel. I absolutely, positively, unequivocally and without reservation 100% guarantee that the one I got does not and will not swivel. It cannot. It was not designed to swivel. If I try to force it to swivel it'll break, because it isn't meant to move that way. The clip has a simple spring-loaded hinge which does not swivel and never will.

 review/summary: Remote does not work with the cube
 review/text: I ordered this product because Amazon mentioned that this remote was often purchased with the cube. I should have done more research because if I would have I would have read that the cube does not have a remote that works with it. Do your research before you purchase. Not really sure if the remote works because it does not work with the speaker I purchased it for. The one star rating is more for Amazon than for the remote itself.

 review/summary: Great Idea!
 review/text: I love my iHome remote, but it doesn't always work the way I would like it to. To make the iHome recieve the signal of the remote, you have to point it directly at the iHome. My iHome is on a shelf pretty far up, and when I'm sitting in my chair it is pretty hard to get that remote aimed just right. I haven't replace my battery, I just use the one that came with it, so maybe it could work better. However, I know a few people who have the same problem as I do. Basically, it's a great accessory but it isn't a miracle.

 review/text: I bought the H3 after losing my Motorola H500. I found that the range is terrible. I know bluetooth headsets don't have great range but I get static on this one if I turn my head for crying out loud. If I have my phone in my pocket it has to be in the pocket on the same side of my body as the headset to avoid terrible static. Also, it really hurt my ear to wear it at first. I guess I suffered through it and am now used to it, but it hurt a lot at first. I just doesn't have the same rubber cushioning as the others. I should have just bought another H500.

 review/summary: Broke after 4 months, otherwise pretty great
 review/text: I really liked this headset for the 4 months that it worked. It was comfortable and had excellent sound quality on both ends. The only problem was the wind noise when using the headset outdoors because the mouthpiece picks up sound so well. However, after 4 months the headset developed a very strange glitch--whenever I used it, my phone would hang up on the person I was talking to, put them on hold, redial them on the other line, then hang up on one or both lines. Considering that there are no buttons on the headset, I think this is awfully bizarre. I tried the headset with a motorola v300 and v188 and had the same problem with both. Neither phone has this problem when I don't use the headset, so I concluded that problem was the headset.In spite of this problem, I'm still considering buying another Plantronics headset because most headsets out there have such poor sound quality or such an uncomfortable design that I can't bear to use them at all.

 review/summary: Feature rich cell phone, not a PDA!
 review/text: First, let me say, this is not a PDA replacement; this is a cell phone. It has pretty much all of the same functionality as my old Motorla T720, with a better phone and some extras.[...]Where this device shines is text messaging and general ease of use. The screen on the inside of the phone is large and crisp, making for easy entering of contacts and typing of text messages. The keyboard is nice and large, and the thumb typing is among the best I've experienced.Reception seems on par with other devices I use. I am still getting better signal in some places over my T720. So while it may not be any better, it sure isn't any worse.Camera seems decent; I haven't had a camera phone before, so I am not really qualified to make a review on this functionality. Seems to do pretty well in well-lighted applications, low light is somewhat weak. The "flash" is just a white LED on the front, that doesn't give all that much light.The VCast video-on-demand is neat and all, but the content is pretty weak right now. I may look into it again once it becomes more rooted. When I got this phone the day after it was released, there was hardly any games or other content downloadable, but recently there has been a boom in available applications on GetItNow.The phone is somewhat heavy and large compared to some of the newer, sleeker phones. My T720 flip phone was about the same size, so it doesn't bother me.Conclusion? A very neat and geeky cell phone. I do a great deal of text messaging, so this was the perfect phone for me.Again, this is a cell phone through and through, _NOT_ a PDA. If you want anything to do with Outlook syncing, e-mail, or other of the more advanced applications, look at a blackberry, smartphone, or pocketpc phone.

 review/text: After spending money on two covers that did not work due to low quality and design problems, I looked at reviews here at Amazon and noticed this model was one of the very few with good feedback.The leather is of a very good quality and so is the craftsmanship.This case does keep your Treo from being damaged and is comfortable to use.Two things you should know. There are times when the phone is activated by the case as it twists to contour your body.Also, you need to keep the keyboard side away from the magnet that keeps the cover closed. All in all a great product!

 review/summary: Excellent Phone
 review/text: I've always had a Verizon phone, but I've always had trouble with them. I'm a phone abuser, and when it comes to cheap phones, they never last long. Until recently I was using a very cheap Motorola, and it could not stand up to my abuses. I finally switched to this phone, and I must say, I'm very happy.I've never felt the need for a camera phone, interchangable faceplates, downloading ringtones, or even playing games on my phone. Voice-activated dialing and text-messaging have been things I like to use, and this LG is great for them.The huge colour display is a plus. I've never liked squinting at a tiny, monochrome LCD display -- like I said, cheap phones. The display is easy to read, and very bright; you can even use it as a flashlight. The buttons are easy to read and easy to press. I have no trouble dialing or answering calls.The features on this phone are also excellent, albeit limited. I use the calandar function all the time, and it's simple and easy to write down appointments and dates to remember. The alarm is clear and loud, louder than my alarm clock next to my bed. The speakerphone is also great. It's loud, crisp, and no one has trouble hearing me on the other end.While I've never been a fan of interchangeable faceplates, the LG doesn't disappoint me. I use the one in the picture because I'm too lazy to actually buy a new one, but the ones LG offers are great.Overall, this is an excellent phone: easy to use, sturdy, and stylish.

 review/summary: A great phone if you want just a phone.
 review/text: I got this phone as part of an employee discount program my husband's company had, and I was able to choose from about a dozen phones. In the past I have worked where camera phones are not permitted at the place of employment, so I wanted to get "just a phone" without all of the extra goodies in case I worked again at a similar employer.I usually have good reception with this phone, and bought it because it was one of the few that had an external antenna. The size is nice (I don't even bother with a case, it's small enough to fit in my pocket) and the voice quality is quite good -- many times people do not know I am on a cell.This phone works well enough that I did not get landline service when we recently moved. I would certainly recommend this phone to anyone wanting a reliable phone without 3000 glitzy features.

 review/text: I have had this phone and the Virgin service for several months. After reading other reviews, let us just say that things like wallpaper, funky ringtones, games and the like do not impress me. I just want a phone that works, which this one does ... and very well. The only down side is that Virgin is on the Sprint PCS net, and there is no roaming. I have a good clear signal when I have a signal, but without roaming it's not that great in rural areas. Virgin's prices are good, and the phone is a good solid communicator.

 review/summary: Some improvements over the 8500 series
 review/text: I previously owned an Audiovox 8500 and upgraded to the 8610. It is an improved phone in many ways. The keypad is larger and easier to operate. The screen has color. The 8610 lacks the voice dialing feature, but I didn't really miss it. However, I had to return the phone when I discoverd that the ringtones on the 8610 are only 1/2 as loud as the ringtones on the original 8500. In noisy environments, I couldn't hear the phone ringing. So I'm back to my 8500.

 review/text: I have been reading the reviews on this phone and have to put in my two cents. I have been with Virgin Mobile for 4 years and have been very pleassed. The plan serves my needs to a T. I personally don't understand all the complaining about wallpaper,ring tones etc. That is not what a cell phone if for. If you want a toy, or something to play with, go to Toys R Us. The Sprint network could be a little stronger, but for most purposes this phone and Virgin Mobile are great. The only thing that I would consider a slight problem with this phone is the ringer is not loud enough and you may miss a call.

 review/summary: Best for Treo 650
 review/text: I've tried both the Motorola HS810 and the Treo bluetooth headsets, and this by far is the best one. The problem with Motorola is that it doesn't synch with the Treo 650 100% of the time; while the Treo headset has very poor volume (I need to be in a quiet room to hear anything). The Cardo Scala 700 has great fit (it sits right over the ear canal), great volume (even when driving with windows down), and it synchs with the Treo 650 all the time. This is the headset I'd recommend for anyone with the Treo 650.

 review/summary: Actually works with the Treo 650
 review/text: I can't even begin to tell you the hell I've been through with other BT headsets and the Treo 650. They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired. And the volume was not loud enough. I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one. The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing. I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time. Even in noisy environments. No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies). Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call. In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day. This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10. I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging. Just amazing! They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor. Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise. It's not bad though, but can be annoying. Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear. But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it. It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger). The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650. I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.

 review/summary: Did I Receive the Same Product?
 review/text: I do a bit of remote PC support and liked the idea of utilizing a hands-free bluetooth set that I could sync with my Motorola Razr. I did a lot of research and felt that this looked to be the best in quality; unfortunately I was in for a surprise.There honestly were no positives:1) There was a lot of static on my end, no matter where I placed the phone.2) The headset feels CHEAP - feels like a 25-cent toy.3) The kicker - I can't stand the way it fits on the ear; unfortunately it just hangs there. It IS possible to bend the earpiece to sort-of fit your ear but nothing really ever felt secure. I couldn't smile or shake my head without constantly wondering if the headset would fall off.I gave it a few days and called it quits. Now this was the first headset I had ever used and was expecting the best and received what seemed like the worst. I intended to try another before I'd go out and purchase a full blown headset so I did a little research and decided to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and what a difference - no static, solid, and it fits SECURELY.

 review/summary: Depends on you
 review/text: The sound quality of this headset is pretty good. It looks and feels very poorly made, almost like if you drop it it would just break which is not a very reasurring quality that you would want in a headset. Personally when i get a headset I would rather not a have a little plastic piece that i put in the blue tooth and then around my ear.the main reason i wanted to return it was that it hurt my ear and did not fit right at all. My friend put it in his ear and had no problems it depends on if you happen to have a larger ear and don't care about the filmsy problem then its very well priced and go for it, if you have small ears like me and my mother (who also bought one and returned it because it just has no padding and is sharp and hurts), then i would not recommend this headset.

 review/summary: A great bluetooth earpiece
 review/text: I bought this to replace my lost Motorola H700. I like its small ear loop which makes it fit nicely with my glasses or sunglasses. It was easy to set up and the voice quality is very clear.The only negative to it is that it is difficult to turn on and off. If you forget that it is on and answer the phone, you have to locate the earpiece or switch the phone.

 review/summary: Scala 700--Great!
 review/text: This is the best bluetooth headset I've tried. I've had it almost 2 months now, and it's rarely become unpaired, even after my Treo 700p has been turned off or reset, or after I've turned the headset off. It sometimes loses connection with the phone, in which case I just have to press the control button once to establish the connection again. The sound is good, both on my side and the receiver's side--nobody has ever complained. It's also very small, light, and comfortable, once you adjust the earpiece.It's got some great features. You can turn off the blinking light, you can cause it to buzz, thus, locating it when you can't find it, and you can determine the battery level or charging level using its lights. It charges quickly using the adaptor or usb connector and your computer, and the battery lasts a long time.I've tried the Plantronics 510 and 350, and the Motorola 700, and none of them stayed paired with my Treo. I also owned a Scala 500, but I lost it the first week I owned it. While I liked it, it was heavier and not as comfortable as the 700, and the sound was clipped.All in all, a great bluetooth headphone at a great price!

 review/text: This is the third brand of headset I have tried and I keep going back to my old standby, a Motorola H555. The Cardo is OK but the ear loop broke after 2 weeks and I only use it about an hour a day. The signal doesn't seem as strong as the Motorola but the sound quality is pretty good. I am still looking for the perfect headset. My next pick will be a Plantronics 520.

 review/summary: So far so good
 review/text: I got my headset yesterday and so far, so good. The sound quality is good; I can hear well and people have no complaints about my talking. The previous reviewer warned about how hard it can be hanging it on the ear and that part will take getting used to. I expect to have to say to callers "Hold on a moment while I put on my headset." But it can go on either side of the head, which is good. The on/off button on the cable works. The volume control works.An even better payoff is that although I got this one to be compatible specifically with my Motorola cell phone, it also works fine with my aged Lucent cordless handset, and I wanted a new headset for that too. This is inexpensive enough so I've just ordered a second headset so I can keep one attached to my old cordless at home and have one to travel with my cell phone.I've given it only 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to see how well it survives wear and tear. However, it's off to a good start.

I saw many people having problems with answering a call with the boom, but I haven't.(I have a Nokia 6126). People say they noticed I was on a headset, but they didn't say that until I asked what they thought of the sound quality and told them I was on it. The controls are easy. Connecting it was a cinch.If you want a good Bluetooth headset, this one is well worth the $$$!

 review/summary: The best on the market at this time.
 review/text: This is my 11th different bluetooth headset that I've tried over the past year and it's been been the best, by far, of the ones I've tried. Is it the best it could be....not by a long shot but it works and that goes a long way.I use it for business calls and have yet to be called on it. That within it self makes it a winner but the Gennum nxZen almost works that good. The difference is I can hear this one with relative ease as opposed to the nxZen. If you boost the microphone (on the nxZen)gain it decreases the in audio which is a issue. I prefer the "in-the-ear" type headset because I'm always using it in loud places like airports etc. The built in boom slides forward and provides excellent out audio for the receiver. I still, struggle at times, hearing the caller. The talk time, so far, is very good. I can wear it for several hours but at some point my ear does start hurting.I use this with my Treo 700w. It drops the pairing on a semi-regular basis. It was easy to pair to my original phone but I've not been able to pair it with any other thing.Overall, if you been waiting then wait no more. It's worth price.

 review/summary: Forget bluetooth, go with this one!
 review/text: I use a blackberry as my phone and hate holding the brick up to my ear to talk. I have tried numerous headsets and this is by far the best! I'm also very picky about electronics and read may reviews before purchasing an item, so if you're like me, keep reading.I've tried bluetooth headsets and found they all produced too much static and anyone I spoke to said I sounded distant. I've tried other wired headsets and they either fell off my ear or made it sound like I was on speaker phone. This is the ONLY headset I have found that 1) stays on my ear very comfortably and 2) sounds great both to me and the person I am speaking to. In fact, no one I have spoken to while wearing this headset has been able to identify that I was wearing a headset.The only reason I gave this headset 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find it to be a little quiet. It may just be my phone's output, yet I do wish the speaker was a little louder sometimes.

 review/text: This phone is good and bad. I really wished it had Picture Caller ID. Also, after dropping it once, it all started falling apart. The volume adjust arrows don't work, my antenna is chipping away. The games on it are horrible unless you're into flying a spaceship around tying to kill little alien ships. Then you can't even download any games to it. I recommend to not get this phone. I had the X427 before this and it was not that great either. Battery life does not last. I have had the phone for about 5 months and I am on my 3rd battery. The phone often freezes and I sometimes have to end a call by removing the battery. The only good thing is the camera but if this phone had picture caller ID, that would be a great feature. My next phone will not be made by Samsung, I am sure of that.

 review/text: I was surprised with the quality of this device for the money. I was skeptical about how good this would be for the money. I use it to hold my Blackberry 8830 while I'm using the navigation features, and it works perfectly. Highly reccomend.

 review/summary: Good Data device, Poor phone
 review/text: The 8700 is an outstanding data device for checking e-mail browsing the web and keeping in sync with outlook. Some additional features like a MP3 player, storage expansion, and voice activated dialing would make it the perfect data device. The 8700 is a below par phone. The mic seems to pick up any background noise and is often not usable in a noisey environment. I don't know if there are quality issues, but my first 8700c died after 4 months of use. Bottom line... If you can use another phone and have the 8700 as a data only tool it is good, if you need a good cell phone first... keep looking.

 review/summary: The Best Blackberry Yet. The Best PDA on The Market
 review/text: I have used the Treo and Blackberry over the years and without a doubt the new Blackberry 8700c is the best PDA on the market. The Intel 312MHZi is very fast and the keyboard is perfect. The only downside to this and most PDA devices is they make better PDA's than Cell Phone. I use my 8700C just for business emails and I love it.

 review/text: I bought the headset about 3 weeks ago and so far I am very happy with it. The sound quality is very good and it is easy it use. The only small complaint I have is that I wish the volume could go a little louder. In general, the headset is easily to put on and fits good around on the ear. Another benefit is that it uses the same USB cable as my blackberry.For the price I think its a must have!

 review/summary: Small, clear and good usability
 review/text: I got this about a week ago. So far this has been great. I like its small size. My boss has the HS850 with the boom mic and all it looks a bit bigger than mine. Sound quality is excellent. I have Sony Ericsson Z520a. I could talk with the windows rolled down on busy roads. Have not tried on freeways, but why would you roll down your windows on a freeway.The only problem I found was redial. I kept it in my shirt pocket, and it redialed my friend the button is very sensitive. I used it in DMV with a big Queue and it worked perfect. For the most part I will keep the headset I am comparing against HS850, but I found few reviews where volume is a problem with HS850, the volume with this set is perfect. I will come back with more review if I happen to change it.

 review/text: Well, actually I was a little disappointed with this headset. The volume controls on the headset aren't sensitive enough for easy volume changes. And you have to push the connect/disconnect button pretty hard to activate. However, the biggest problem I have with this is that the ear holder doesn't rotate around the earbud axis. So you can only control the positioning one dimensionally. It's not as comfortable as my old one as a result.

On both of the holsters I purchased, this little tab broke off. Very poor design and substandard manufacturing. Don't waste your time or your money on this item.

I love the fact that it has a volume control *AND* a mute button. Great for conference calls. It's very comfortable to wear. Shure is better for clarity, but the Shure ear bud also goes in about 1/4 inch in to your ear canal! This one just touches the ear and the sound is just as good. Best of all, EVERYONE is surprised when I tell them I'm on a headset.

 review/summary: Headset
 review/text: I have tried to use the blue tooth headsets for years. I can never remember to keep them charged. I opted for the wired headset. I now have 3 of these. Keep them specifically in the cars. They work and are comfortable. I know the cable can be challenging, but you don't have to keep them charged up. Be careful, you may have to have the adapter cable to fit various headsets. I recommend buying the adapter at the same time, they are inexpensive. All in all, I find the headset comfortable and easy to use. It's not very expensive, if it breaks, buy another. With that being said, I have been using my first headset I bought over a year ago still.

 review/summary: Crystal clear conversation
 review/text: As with all typical Plantronics headsets, this sound is clear and no one can tell you are on a headset on the other end. My only gripe is the cord seems a bit fragile the the earpiece volume is not as loud as it should be for use in a vehicle which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Other than that, it works very well and is fairly comfortable for extended wear on your ear. I like the fact that it does not go over your ear so wearing glasses is not a problem at all.

 review/summary: comfortable headset for cordless home phone
 review/text: I purchased this headset as a replacement. I have gone through several headsets of this type, as I work from home and am the phone quite often. The previous models I've had seem to last only a year or so, and I am hoping that this will exceed that lifetime. I wasn't sure about the 'under ear' fit, and how well it would stay on, but I am glad to say it's actually more comfortable than the 'over ear' styles.As for being "wind smart", I can't answer that because I don't usually use my cordless phone with my headset on while driving down the highway with my head out the window.However, for the money, this headset has met my expectations.

The battery arrived on time and packaged well. I just don't think I can come out ok on this and will probably just buy a new phone.

 review/summary: Excellent phone, excellent service
 review/text: I have been a Cingular customer for 4 years now and have never had any problems with them--ever. As for dropped calls, the only time I have trouble is if I drive by an area with lots of power transformers. I thought the Palm was too much technology for me (I am a college instructor and PhD student) and knew I would not use a lot of the internet capabilities, but after a month, I would be in so much trouble if I lost my Palm. I keep track of projects, work things, assignments, student assignments, etc. on my palm and I love it. I don't have any trouble hearing with either the unit itself or with the earpiece. The price was a bit more than I wanted to pay for a phone, but I had some upgrade credits, so I spent the extra $50 for this phone and I am glad I did. Awesome product!!

 review/summary: Pretty Disappointed
 review/text: I bought the Treo 650 from Cingular about a month ago and they replaced it three times and the third one still doesn't work properly.- With the first phone, the phone would shut down for no apparent reason. Versamail wasn't working correctly either.- With the second phone, phone quality was very bad. In fact, to make or receive any phone calls, I had to put the speakerphone on in order to hear the calls.- With the third phone, same problem as the second phone, but now I don't seem to have service in a lot of areas, including my house (and I live in Manhattan).Other than that, I loved the Treo for all its functionality. It's kind of big for my taste too. I mean, you can put it by your belt in the office, but in late hours or in clubs, you wouldn't want to do that. I returned the 3rd phone. I just couldn't take it anymore.

Looks like the only way to get this is to buy the cradle for over $50...

Yeah, it does look like I'm ready to duel the Joker,but what's wrong with that?

 review/summary: Good basic phone with no bells and whistles
 review/text: This is the phone I am retiring now after about 20 months of use. So I guess I am not allowed to badmouth it too much :)I actually liked this phone. Following is a brief review based on my experience:The best thing about this phone is it looks. It is really lightweight and very sleek. Friends around me were fascinated when I first got this thing. Next, it is what it is: phone. I am not the person who likes a lot of bells and whistles on the phone. Most of the phones around have horrible mp3 playback, awful camera/video capture capability which makes them bulky and heavy. If you are looking for those things, stop looking at cheap phones and go get yourself a blackberry or treo or whatever. This one has skirted everything, and I like that.The signal strength is very good. Much improved than my earlier Motorola V551. The sound quality however was average. Not something to complain about in general, but you would have difficulty hearing if you are in a noisy environment. The speakers are also not loud enough.The bluetooth works great. Never had any problems with the handsfree. The battery life was also good. I had a little problem for about a week a few months back, which resolved itself. The battery was dying down every day for those few days. But for the most part, I used to charge it every other day. I would say, I talk about 60mins per day on an average.The keypad is average. A bit on the small side, but the feel of the keys make it easier. So not much to complain there.The phone is very light and sleek. This also means that it can easily slip from your hands when you are holding it and talking. So if you think you are a bit clumsy, brace yourself for some drops.I got this one as a free phone about two years back. It was good then. But I think there are a lot of better options for the same price in the market now. Not saying that this phone is bad by any means, but I think you can do better for the price (1 cent with contract at the time of review posting).

 review/text: This Parrot MINIKIT Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black) is the best product for hands free. It is more than worth the price. I brought this item for my husband and he loves it. We do not like complicated gagets (modern technology) but this is NOT one of them.It clips on to the sun visor, speakerphone is very clear, battery life is about 10 days (depending on usage) and you would not believe it could be this good. Buy one!Advice to people buying:1. Make sure you store/save your cell numbers to the PHONE (not Sims card). You can save back to Sims card after pairing to Parrot.2. Make sure your cell phone can Voice Name record. You need this option on your cell phone to PAIR with Parrot MINIKIT Bluetooth Speakerphone.

 review/summary: A Lot of Utility in a Small Package
 review/text: The size of cell phones continues to shrink and I really wonder why no one has finally built a Dick Tracy-style video-phone-watch! None of the pictures really do justice to just how portable this phone is, but dimensionally it's smaller than your average business card, though obviously much thicker.I settled on this phone after seeing my father-in-law's, also a 6102i. I've read other reviews talk about the finish flaking, scratches, etc., but he's had his for more than a year, carries it around in his pants pocket and I've seen him drop it more than once. It still looks great.As others have noted, this phone is loaded with a slew of options, so many that navigating around them can be intimidating and requires some time to practice and master. And some of the options are not very intuitive. Still, any reasonably talented teenager could figure out most of the functions without referring to the manual (at least my reasonably talented teenagers did.)My favorite functionality is being able to sync the phone with my contact list and appointments. I was really nervous about attempting this as I have 750+ contacts and many, many appointments. But (after purchasing the optional CA-42 data cable and downloading the free PC suite software) it worked like a champ and gives me a much easier (and faster) method for downloading ring tones, pictures, etc. I found ample support on the web and in the manual to sync my phone, create my own ring tones, and generally personalize my new phone.One bit of advice concerning contact lists - if yours is as large as mine, then scrolling through all 750+ names is going to be a drag. So what I did was to sync the full list one time, then go back into the PC Suite Sync options and change the setting to only update my calendar. Then began the laborious task of working my way through the phone list, deleting everyone except the family members or friends that I actually wanted to have on there.As others have noted, the battery life really is great. I remember my first cell phone in the middle 90's - I had to carry a charger around with me where ever I went and, if the call was important, I'd plug it in first. On an average, even with daily use, I've noticed that I can go approximately two to three days between charging. That's pretty darn good.Security on the phone is only so-so, but then that's true of every phone I've ever used. All phones offer you the option of mandating a PIN be input once the phone is turned on, but then it stays turned on and never prompts you for it again. I understand why this is true - who wants an extra 4 to 10 digits when you want to make a call? Still, it bothers me that if I lose my phone, or if it's stolen, then odds are that it'll be on and, at least until the battery dies, who ever has it can browse the web, call all over the world, and have access to my address book (and now pictures and who know what else) until I notice it's gone and call my provider to have them shut down the SIM. What I really want is a phone that'll need a pin to make a call or access my address book, but I'm an InfoSec guy and being anal-retentive is considered an asset, rather than a detriment, in my career field.As far as the other options, I've used the camera only once (to prove it worked) and the quality was pretty good. I've noticed that to get good pictures you really should have adequate lighting (well, okay, broad daylight) but even interior shots are fair to middling. I've played with the Tetris game sitting in my dentist's waiting room, but other that I haven't really used the many, many other tools this phone provides.I have some complaints, but they're really minor. For example, there's no way to set a "day view" in the calendar. When you open up your calendar, it defaults to a month view, with the current date selected, and then you can select the day to see a list of appointments. Annoying, but since I only use the calendar function as a reminder for appointments I've set with my PC, it's not that big a deal. Also, there appears to be no way to change the default appointment tone, which disappoints me only slightly.And as far as the Dick Tracy watch is concerned - who needs to wear a watch anymore? If it wasn't for the fact that I just love the look and style of my Invicta Swiss Diver (and the fact that it, unlike my Nokia 6102i, is waterproof) I'd never need to wear one!

 review/summary: basic and decent phone
 review/text: I just switch from ATT business to Cingular business and it still took more than a week to port my number. I tried 2+ years ago when they first merged with ATT but each department blamed the other for not completing the transaction. After many, many phone calls & 10+ hours of "customer care", I gave up. The only reason for not switching providers was the fabulous discount of 16% plus I had virtually no problems and good clarity even on the old TDMA service of ATT. I relocated a bit and travel a lot so I need a good solid "US" network. I had a TDMA Nokia "brick" phone, which is durable, reliable and still in decent shape. The Nokia 6102i was the lowest of the 2 flip phones offered for my "upgrade". I was skeptical after I read the reviews for this phone on cnet. I use Amazon reviews a lot for my purchases and found they more accurately reflected my own experiences with the products. And after reading the reviews here, I did not cancel the phone. I ordered the RAZR a few months earlier with another provider, when Cingular was telling me I'll need to jump through hoops again but thanks to the numerous, detailed descriptions of the reviewers here, I cancelled that order and that contract. As for the Nokia 6102i, as stated by many other reviewers here, it's a decent phone with VGA camera plus bluetooth. I have it for 2 weeks but service for 1 week and the battery life is great!!! I played with the phone and most of its functions, talked on it for 2+ hours, took 7 pictures, IR sync and after 1+ week, it just dropped to 2 bars out of 4...description on Cingular have talk time at 4 hours. Speakerphone was loud and decent, voice dialing and voice recording works well plus I did not have low volume or inaudible ringer as stated on cnet. Speakerphone is not one touch activation as other phones but 3 steps. I have the phone setting to outdoors and it's really loud. Pictures were really good quality for a camera phone. The phone book and menu is not well arranged as others. I had to go to the manual twice. If you're use to using stuff out of the box immediately, you might get a bit frustrated. It's not sleek but does have a nice solid feel/heft. Haven't tested the bluetooth or internet service yet. I'm also trying the LG CU400 since that was the phone I originally requested but was denied. Overall, I'm tempted to keep this phone and cancel the order for the LG because it's a good functional phone and all of the features I need meets or exceed expectation.

 review/summary: Won't have another one.
 review/text: So, in the space of about eleven months, I had three of these things. The display died on the first one; got it replaced under a warranty exchange. Was very unhappy to discover that I couldn't just walk into (what was then) a Cingular storefront and get it replaced on the spot; had to go through the rather painful rigamarole with Cingular online -- and I was on the road at the time. Not. happy.Then, a few months later, something went wrong with the hinge on the second phone. The phone itself was spotless, as was observed by the fellow in the (now) AT&T; office where I went, once again, to *try* to get some in-person service. Once again, no dice, *and* I got to observe first-hand how shabbily AT&T; was treating their own employees in the local storefront. This time, not even the AT&T; employee *telling* them that the phone had clearly not been abused would get them to replace the thing under warranty. Yes, I had to pay for a new phone.It's some months later now, and the third phone has shown hints of having the hinge problem (won't close properly, display won't sleep). My contract is up at this point; when this one dies, I'll be getting something else. Possibly an LG. (I have observed for myself how tough those puppies are.) Whether I'll be staying with AT&T; is the main question. Verizon isn't an option (not available in my area), and is anyone else really any better? We seem to be back to the bad old days of "We don't care; we don't have to. We're the phone company."Update, September 2008: Just replaced this phone for the last time. The hinge broke on the third one the same way it did on the second one. I have a Pantech phone now. We'll see how it goes.

 review/summary: A OKAY Phone
 review/text: This phone is bad & good. Most teens, like myself, tend to drop their phones, put them in their pockets, or leave at the boottom of their purses. Well, this does not withstand any of this, the antenna casing pops off, exposing the atenna, the paint on the outside comes off very easily. And if you have alot of phone numbers, it won't hold all of them. It only holds a few ringtones or pictures. I used to have a motorola, but it was nearly as bad, except that it held ALOT more. So, parents if buying a phone for a younger child then go ahead and get it, but for teens, don't waste your money! Try a BlackBerry, there alot stronger & more expensive but a little better!

 review/text: I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart. It was $30 at Best Buy. I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10? I'm buying two more. I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems. It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom. The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume?

 review/summary: Excellent Sound
 review/text: I originally bought one of these at Staples for $20. I had tried a few expensive bluetooth Motorolla's @ Costco and they were horrible so I had to return them. My husband had older chorded headset that came w/his phone and he said he actually liked having the chord because the connection & sound was very clear. So I tried this one and was not only happy to see it included adaptor but that the sound was excellent. I didn't tell my husband I had purchased it and when I called he couldn't even tell.I ended up looking for an extra adapter and found the same headset on Amazon for $15+ less then what I paid local. So I ordered another one for our other car and an extra adapter. The only negative thing I found about it is I really liked the voice dialing/answer/disconnect button but shortly after buying it the automated voice for voice dialing dropped so low I can't tell what she's saying & I have to fumble through. There wasn't any clear instructions on how it's powered (?) so I'm assuming it's powered through the phone... again (?).... I haven't used the 2nd one I bought yet so I'll see what happens with that one & research it a bit more.

 review/text: Okay, not the best. Sound Quality is marginal - everytime is switch over to my headset, the receiving party asks what happened and why they can't hear me as well. Definitely not what I was gong for. Also, the piece that fits around the ear is NOT adjustable. This means that unless your ear fits the exact arc (kind of large, I have average sized ears); it does not feel snug and has a tendency to "shimmy" out. If anyone knows of a headset that has great voice quality and stays put (even while jogging), please let me know! :)

I am pleased with the good service of the company I bought them from and the price was very reasonable.

 review/text: The sound quality is excellent and the instant ability to use voice command is impressive. There is a bit of a learning curve on using it and it is a bit sensitive on the commands, but overall very good. I also like the fact that there are only a few buttons and by differing the length of the touch of the button you can do a variety of commands. Good product!

 review/text: I have tried many different bluetooth devices and this one is the worst. I had to hold my phone (Ipnone) so close to it I may as well have put my phone to my ear. When my phone was clipped to my belt the BT500 you cut in and out when I was either listening or speaking. While wear the BT500 it was like walking around with your finger in your ear. There are other bluethooth devices that rest on your ear instead of in your ear. I would not reccommend this product.

 review/text: This is the second Jabra headset I have purchased. The fit is excellent and it stays in my ear; other headsets are just not as comfortable. The only complaint that I have is that the headset will not just answer an incoming call, like my old one, I have to flip the phone open to answer. I can then close it and continue my conversation. This is a problem with the set-up of the phone, not the headset. The volume controls work great and the on-off switch is easy to use. Bottom line? This is a great headset and I highly recommend it.

 review/summary: Quite happy with so far...
 review/text: I purchased this item as a replacement for a lost Motorola bluetooth headset for my Treo 650. As I lost my prior headset (and I am not a careless or disorganized person) I decided that a larger model might be a better idea. I have been quite happy with the sound quality and ability to hear, even when in an area with a lot of ambient noise. The multiple gel earpiece covers are a definite plus, as is the USB cable. Pairing the headset with the Treo worked fine. The only reason I am giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is that the style is a bit more functional than stylish.

 review/text: I had a motorola Bluetooth headset. I felt like Lt. Uhura with a giant ear piece in StarTrek. I had a hard time keepig it in and after 20 mintues it hurt my ear. It came with my accessory kit in one box with the car charger and case so I just used it and grumbled. But when my toddler flushed it I got the Jabra as a replacement.I love it! It works and stays in my ear, feels comfortable even after 3-4hours in my ear. I use it only when I drive and I have used the voice dial and it works perfectly. I set the voice commands using the headset and it works. When I set them without using the headset it did not work well.Great little device.

 review/summary: Works, but not spectacular
 review/text: I found this headset at a store for less than ten dollars after rebates. It works with my Inspiron laptop, but the headset does not support the Advanced Audio Dustribution Profile, so the music and Skype calls comes through on the headset like I am listening on a cell phone. It has a good range, for me that is long enough to go from one side of my house to another. It was a good deal for me to try bluetooth, but I don't know if I would reccomend it to others or not. I use it sporadically and in my home, so I don't have problems with it being too quiet or having a dead battery.

 review/summary: decent headset, sounds "tinny" on the other end
 review/text: This headset is great....if you don't have to listen to someone talk using it. I had no problem using it to call people with the one touch feature (although it was a little annoying that you need to push it the proper amount of time for it to function as intended). I used this headset in conjunction with the verizon razr v3c and found that the two work together quite well. I purchased two of these headsets, one for me and the other for my girlfriend. It does take some getting used to as far as the feel of it ergonomically, as it is light weight and doesn't feel secure. But the sound quality was very good...until I called my girlfriend who is using the same headset. Her voice sounded very tinny, almost like an old boombox playing a cassette tape recording. I was disappointed with the headset in this respect. Otherwise though, it's pretty easy to connect to the phone, and as long as you stay in range is pretty clear. The volume adjustments help a lot too.

 review/text: The case fits well and protects the screen and keys from dirt and debris. It does not however protect the trackball which is still exposed. Only complaint is that the plastic over the keys makes typing a little more difficult than without it, so if you don't need to protect the phone from dirt or grease I recommend getting a case with open keys.

 review/text: this is the fourth color screen phone that i own (previously i owned sony erisson T68, T68i, T610) and i found this phone to be the best among the other sony ericsson phones. the software of this phone is very stable. the menu is pretty user friendly and i like the convenient speaker phone feature with sensitive receiver. people can adjust the volume with the "joystick" while talking, unlike the other ericssion phones where you can find the buttons on the side of the phone. the camera also has 4x zoom feature and able to tune the brightness level of the picture. i think the phone is great for its price and size. the previous sony ericsson phones all have either battery problems or software problems (the phone will turn itself off while using or it keeps pressing "3" ). so far this is the best phone i've ever used. best of all - this is a tri-band phone so i can bring it everywhere around the world.

 review/summary: Cool-looking junk
 review/text: I regret SO SO much buying this phone and considering the price now you'll be out of your mind if you buy it. The reception is the biggest issue, with T-mobile signal you'll be striving almost everywhere to just make a call. When people get out of their house to make a call you know they are using T-mobile... Battery life is the second biggest problem. Provided with only one battery, now I end up having to charge it almost EVERYDAY. Especially with its bluetooth on your battery can run from full to fool in just 40-min talking. Believe it or not now i carry the charger with me wherever I go even if I charged it this morning. Besides these two problems it also freezes for no reason sometimes. The entertaining capabilities is like none--only a couple of stupid games available--and they are trial versions!The response is incredibly slow considering the price and class of the phone. Never take pictures with this phone--It just make me wanna bang this phone against my friend's head who recommended this phone or throw it in fire for good.

 review/summary: Outstanding!
 review/text: This is by far the best phone I ever had. After several years of using Nokia phones and AT&T; Wireless, I finally switched to T-Mobile as soon as they offered the V600. What a difference! The signal strength in the Chicago area is exceptional! All the places where I previously got no or very weak coverage, the V600 shows full signal.The phone itself has great look and feel. A bit heavier than its competitors, but small and easy to use. Good keys, nice bright display. Good sound quality, and even the camera produces somewhat decent pictures (well, not a replacement for 'real' camera, approximately the kind of quality you got from a digital camera five or six years ago).However, the classic Nokia (non-Symbian) user interface and menu structure is slicker and easier to navigate than Motorola's. Personally, I like T9 better than Moto's iTAP input method. Also, it doesn't let you store addresses with the phone directory entries. The battery runtime is a bit short, too; I get about three days, with moderate use, out of it.Pros:- great reception (with T-Mobile, in the Chicago area)- nice look and feel- good keybord, display- good sound qualityCons:- battery time a bit short- no address fields in phone directory- should come with Motorola's phone tools software

 review/summary: V600 - Best Phone on the Market
 review/text: The V600 is the best phone I've ever owned - and I've had quite a few. As a basic phone it works great. It feels good in my hand, it's easy to type in numbers and the voice recognition is excellent. This is especially good with my NY accent. I'm really in love with the blue tooth ear piece that comes with it. The combination is great. People cannot tell I'm talking on an ear piece. You can call and hang up with just the earpiece and even use the voice recognition of the phone. All this while your phone is up to 30 feet away. I use t-mobile as my carrier and find this service provider and phone to give me great reception and sound quality. It's an all GSM phone so when there is no GSM there is no phone service. I thought it might be a problem when I bought it, but it just hasn't been a problem.

 review/summary: Simply a perfect phone
 review/text: I've been using GSM phones for about 15 years in Europe.I moved to the US last year and not knowing anything about US service providers, I decided to go for AT&T...; what a disastre (great national coverage - worst customer service I've ever dealt with - terrible international coverage). So I decided to change and tried T-Mobile (just felt right - perfect so far)and got the V600 mainly for its multi-band capabilities through Amazon. It's by far the best phone I've ever had. Easy to use, perfect camera for phone to phone or e-mail use. Great battery life. Perfect national coverage aswell as in Asia and all over Europe (speak for T-Mobile and the phone). I bought a protective cover as the phone surface scratches easily.The perfect phone for people who travel all over the place.

 review/summary: V600 Is Pretty Mediocre
 review/text: I recently purchased the V600 Motorola phone and the Jabra BT250 Bluetooth headset through Cingular. The phone itself is quite cool. Cingular service in New Jersey and Texas, however, has been very spotty. The Jabra headset and/or V600 have not been worth the trouble. When the combination works, it's very nice. However, I frequently lose the pairing between the two and have to take the SIMM card out of the phone and re-charge the headset (basically re-booting both of them). The earpiece on the headset is pretty weak. I have to hold my finger on it to keep it in my ear so I can hear well. I might as well hold the phone to my ear.

 review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
 review/text: This phone has several problems including: 1. will not download properly 2. will not give indication of voice mail recieved 3. recieves random text messages that no one knows where they are coming from, including t-mobile and motorola. These messages are usually an @ symbol or an antenna symbol with no return number. very annoying!I have called t-mobile and motorola technical support. Motorola tech. support is EXTREMELY pathetic. The techs. are cluless and put you on hold for hours on end.I finally had to mail the phone in because I couldnt take it anymore. I got all the information from motorola website(dont even think about trying to get someone on the phone) to send the phone to their factory service in Texas. These people are pathetic as well. Thier service is poor, they dont let you know when they recieved your phone like they are supposed to, and to top it all off, they sent the phone back saying it was "damaged beyond repair" and wasnt under warrenty because it had "water damage" and "the seal was broken" implying that the user had tampered with the phone and took it apart.None of this was true. The phone was in perfect conditon, not once even dropped or gotten wet.I disputed these claims by writing a letter to motorola customer service, as they suggest you do, and have never recieved a reply!After all this, and deciding maybe I just got a bad phone that was damaged in the warehouse or something, I ordered the exact same phone online from another vendor. This is not a cheap phone, but I figured I could use my non functioning phone for spare parts, extra battery, etc..and buying the same model would have those advantages.Guess what? The new one had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS! I sent it back for a refund minus a 15% restocking fee.I now have $285 dollars invested in a phone that is a piece of crap.I had to resort to putting my old samsung model back into service, which still works perfectly after 2 years of being dropped and abused.DO NOT EVER BUY A MOTOROLA PRODUCT!! Even if you get a good phone, if you ever need service or support, they are liars and will screw you over. Dont get screwed like I did.Also, this phone is not metal, as some ignorant people claim in thier reviews. It is plastic with a cheap aluminum cover that slides on, covering 85% of the plastic, but it is indeed a plastic phone.This phone also had a few additional problems, but to keep this review shorter, I wont go into them. I think I made my point with what I included.

 review/summary: Buyer beware!
 review/text: I would recommend against buying this phone. It's not worth changing your service to T-Mobile with a horrible phone like this one just to get a great rebate. I purchased the V600 from Amazon in Nov last year, and had nothing but trouble with it. My main complaints were that the reception was very poor, and I was experiencing a large number of dropped calls. I realize that the T-Mobile service may not be the best in Los Angeles, but I have quite a few friends (using different phones) who have no complaints about the service - which leads me to believe this phone is to blame.If you are an extremely patient person who doesn't mind bad reception and constantly having to call the person whom you're talking to five times in order to complete your conversation, I guess this is a good phone for the money. It's pretty compact (although heavy), has a decent camera, the buttons are okay, and the clamshell design is nice. I tested the speakerphone quite a bit, and it worked very well.Bottom line: If you value reception quality, stay away from this phone! If not, then it's a pretty good deal.

 review/text: My husband has had a couple of these phones over the past few years. He is in the towing business, so you can imagine what kind of abuse it gets. When we had to replace his first one, it was just worn out because he used it so much. It is a very good basic phone with a few extras on it. He just wants a phone that works with a camera :-) This is a very good phone to have if you are in any type of a rough environment ie: construction, towing, heavy machinery or if you drop it a lot. I don't recall if it's water resistant, but it's been a few puddles and survived well!

 review/text: Powers up my Nokia phone and holds a strong charge for a great price. I have no complaints with the performance and it works fantastic. My original battery still functioned but lost power only after a couple of calls. This replacement one works like a charm.

 review/summary: Not the correct battery.
 review/text: I ordered a replacement battery for a Nokia 6555 and this was the battery that came up in the search. This is not the correct battery and the company that sent it tried to fix the problem, but it never worked out. I don't know how the battery worked because it didn't fit in my phone. The reason this rating is low is because this wasn't the item I needed.

 review/summary: works well and comes with a bonus surprise
 review/text: There were not a lot of options for a mobile headset that was corded and was for one ear. It fits snug in the ear and the microphone works great. The bonus surprise that came the headset was a 3.5mm male to 2.5mm female adapter. I was shocked because I had also ordered an adapter from another company. There is no mention of this adapter that I saw with the headset, so now I have two.

It's inconvenient, when convenience is paramount. The charger works just fine.

This is definitely an item one should try before buying.

When your phone rings, it's tough to get it out of the case in order to answer it in time.Perhaps the same material, but in a flip phone design would work better.

There is no bulky clip for a belt, and because it's so thin, the phone and case fit into the phone slots in your purse/bag. This keeps the phone finish from being scratched. It's the best phone case I've had.

Only problem we had was the clips were broken on both of the chargers we received. Not sure if they came from a bad batch or what. I superglued them back on, and they seem to be ok now. Should not have had to do that, but I didn't buy them for the light anyway. The charger works as you would expect.

Once you understand the basics it's relatively easy to useI bought this back in mid 2007 and after trying to use it and running into battery issues, I gave up. I never bothered to call the manufacturer and have it replaced.Recently, I got a new TV to replace my old Sony Wega that came w/ a wireless headset and was in need of a headset. Re-discovered this unit. Since one battery is dead, I have to keep the adapter plugged into a USB port but can then attach it to the headphone jack of the TV and use the headset to watch TV w/o making noise.

 review/summary: Functions well and protects iPod case
 review/text: I am very happy with this product on the whole. It has protected my iPOD well for over a year. The reason I am giving it four stars is that the "removable" belt clip was removable initially but then I screwed it in tight once and I have not been able to remove it. The belt clip works great and the hold button is accesible without opening the case and I am satisfied with this product.

 review/summary: Poor design for Palm IIIc
 review/text: To use this product, you have to remove the plastic hard cover from your Palm IIIc organizer. The leather case fastens with a snap so you could attach it to a belt,purse,or brief case, etc. But, it flops around and is not easily accessed for quick use. I wanted a product similar. And, I sure wish I could design my own. I want a clip on leather case - (secure fit like ones used for pagers). I want to be able to open the leather case easily, then, raise the plastic cover and use the orangizer. It would also be nice to have a place to store an extra stylus and credit cards or name cards. Thank you. I will keep searching.

 review/text: I've had this phone for about a year, and I have not been pleased with its service. The number keys are small and have a tendency to stick. I have to punch the number several times before the number acutally dials. None of the &quot;special&quot; features are worth anything. In my opinion, there are much better phones (for the same price) out on the market today.

 review/summary: Lavender??
 review/text: The color is more pink than lavender. You're lucky if you don't break the clips on the front cover trying to get the thing on the first time. The good thing is once it's on it's basically on for good, it is a snug fit and recovers well from dropping. Better to scratch the case than the phone. The downside is that it increases both the weight and thickness of the phone by approx 50% and the life expectancy isn't that great. I had the blue case and when it broke I bought the lavender one (neither lasted 6 months).

 review/summary: So happy!!!!!
 review/text: I had been searching for an armband that could carry my iphone and still be large enough for my arms. After purchasing 4 others and a month long search I found this case. Here are some great qualities. My iphone has a large protective case on it and it fit still whenit did not in any other. I work out daily and sweat always feeds through to the phone on other bands. This one does not. Usually they cut off circulation from being so tight. This band is great up to 20" biceps and has a soft flexible strap that is easy to adjust. Also, the screen cover is made of a better more usable plastic. The strength of this armband exceeded every other band I looked at. High quality stitching with enforced corners. You are still able to use your phone with the holes provided. Volume adjustment is easier, phone silence button is easier, speakers are exposed for non headphone use. The only problem I found was that I am not geting paid to write this. Great product. Buy one!

 review/summary: En Masse Satisfaction for Curve 8310
 review/text: So, this is exactly what I've been looking for. It fits the Curve 8310 from AT&T; perfectly even if you have the extended battery.Three issues:1) The little retaining hook at the top will quickly scrape off the rubberizing material on the very top of the device.2) It has no magnet to put the BB to sleep (it has a place for one so I fixed this by taping in one from another case which I do not use).3) The top retaining piece of the clip broke after a few months (granted, I was futzing with it quite a bit).Point is, I paid less than a dollar for this, plus shipping. So, after the first broke, I bought three more. This means I've still paid substantially less for a product I like than one I do not. I keep a spare in my bag, and I'm good to go. When new one breaks (not happened yet) I move the magnet to the next one and I'm happy, and it's cheap.Did I mention it's cheap? Hope this helps! I tried others, and this is really, really hard to beat.

 review/text: The iGo Stowaway is a great keyboard, and with the low price I paid through Amazon I had to get it. It paired up easily with my Nokia N800 (which had OS2007 on it at the time). However, since "upgrading" to OS2008 it will not pair no matter what I try. Not sure what the problem is but if I can't find a fix it's useless to me. You may not have this problem and in that case you'll appreciate the compact size made possible by clever engineering. It is fragile so one must be careful with it, but with reasonable care (if you can get it to pair!) it should last a long time.

 review/summary: Great keyboard for Galaxy S3
 review/text: I purchased this keyboard after doing some prelimiary research, hoping that it would work alright with the galaxy S3. The alternatives that specifically supported the android OS seemed too flimsy for any real use, whereas this keyboard has long been regarded as one of the best portable bluetooth keyboards ever made.From the moment I first opened the keyboard, I knew this was it. The build quality was excellent for such a compact and light keyboard. Metal hinges, comfortable keys, clever design with a flip-out stand - great piece of engineering.The keyboard paired easily, and I could use the basic keys right away. However, I wanted to re-define some of the mapped keys to execute android-specific tasks (launching specific apps, controlling volume, wifi, blue-tooth, etc.). Unfortunately, the driver that loads is pretty basic, and doesn't allow for any remapping.I eventually came across an app called "external keyboard helper pro" from the android marketplace. for ~ 3 dollars, and a little bit of patience, I was able to get the keyboard to funciton perfectly, as if it was made for the galaxy S3! If anyone is in the market for a great bluetooth keyboard for an anroid phone, I would strongl recommend this device.

 review/summary: Great keyboard for UMPC
 review/text: I bought this to use with a Samsung Q1 and it works great - connects quickly and no lag in keystrokes at all. It's very small so I can pack the Q1 and the Stowaway almost anywhere. I had no problem with the initial pairing, the instuctions were in the box. It takes a little while to get used to not having the top row of number keys but if you place your fingers on the home keys by feel and not by sight then it's no problem. I kept wanting to start typing one row below normal because I felt like I should start on the third row instead of the second row. The key spacing feels normal and accessing the numbers with the function key becomes natural after a while. The bottom line is that it is small. It takes up very little space when in use and very, very little space when folded and put away. I don't know about other devices, I have not tried it with my Ipaq or laptops (My Q1 replaced the Ipaq and I don't see why anyone would need it with a laptop). If you have a Q1 or other UMPC then I think this is the perfect keyboard for it.

 review/text: I bought this to use with the Nokia 770 Tablet. Opening the keyboard was a little tricky and I was careful because it feels delicate. I don't have confidence this keyboard is built for hard use, but for occasional/regular use it will hopefully work well. The keys have a positive and responsive light touch. The key layout is a little different than standard ones, but OK. The small pocketable size when folded is awesome. The bluetooth synced up nicely with the 770 using the OS2006 maemo bluetooth plugin download. The price was the clincher. At 29.95 from Amazon, how can one go wrong for a bluetooth keyboard?

 review/summary: Pretty Good - will take some time to get used to, though
 review/text: I've been in the market for a really good PDA keyboard as the functionality of my Palm LifeDrive is seriously undermined without a keyboard. Anyway, after reading a lot about this one, I decided to go for it. I'm not one for reading manuals and such - I just jump right in & start playing with it; that's the easiest way to learn to use a new gadget as far as I'm concerned. It looks like this one is going to take a little extra time though. I'm happy with the key size b/c it's standard and very easy to type (my fingers don't feel cramped). It opens quite easily & I'm glad for a change, this one came with batteries. The left AND right 'Fn' keys are throwing me a little - that will take some time to get used to...and I consider myself a very seasoned (and fast) typer. With so many functions/cababilities stuffed into so few keys, (I don't expect anything else from such a compact keyboard...it must be quite a feat for the manufacturer), you have to literally stop typing and look for the exact key sequence you need. The stand is pretty good - not super solid, but from what I've heard of other keyboard stands, this one is passable. The break in the spacebar is not as much of an issue as some other users may make of it - that is a personal judgement call though. Overall, a good keyboard, it should turn out to be a good investment unless something completely weird happens. It will take some time to get used to & I feel like I'll definitely use it. The more I use it, the more comfortable I should become with it. I would recommend this keyboard; I loved that I got free shipping...that's always fun. Product arrived on time for me.

 review/text: Not a bad product but it doesn't work for my BB 8700c even though the maker's web site says it does. The problem I have is that my BB is on BES and using this keyboard requires security changes that are administered by the BES administrator. If you are not very technical or if you use BES, I suggest you look for another product.On the bright side, I did get this to work with my PS3. Not all of the keys work on it, though.

 review/summary: Very reliable -- and holds a charge
 review/text: I bought this to replace a junky Motorola V180. I use a cell phone for calls and text messages and an alarm clock.My dropped calls have gone to zero. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be the network, but this phone is just better at not dropping calls with Cingular.It took me awhile to figure out how to make unique ringtones for a person -- you can only have unique ringtones for a group, so first you put the person in their own group. I guess that's pretty useful because I have a bunch of people that I like to ignore, so I was able to put them in a group that was silent when they called.I don't like the middle navigation key. It is too hard to push and it's easy to accidentally push the other ones. I use the middle key a lot because carrying the phone in my purse means that I need to lock the keys. You use the middle key to lock the keyboard.

 review/summary: Decent quality, fair price
 review/text: My biggest objection to the Galaxy SIII, at least my white one, is that it's slippery. I've almost dropped it several times. The boxwave &#34;cover&#34; solves that, while adding minimal bulk to the phone. A friend has an Otterbox case, and it's just too big and bulky for me. This BoxWave case doesn't offer the same level of protection, but the phone still fits easily in my hand and my pants pocket. It's a little more expensive than most of the no-name TPU cases available, but it seems to be well made, it fits well, and all the holes are pretty much in the right place. And rather than having a hole that you have to try to operate the power and volume buttons through, the case incorporates button extensions that are easy to push.I had a little bit of problem getting the holes in the case lined up over the ports, flash, camera and speaker in the phone, and it took me several tries to get it lined up correctly. If it doesn't fit right at first, keep trying. It seems to fit better if you start on the volume control side of the phone and stretch it over the power button side.

 review/summary: Great fit
 review/text: Cut-outs are a great fit. Perfect around Camera lens, Speaker and Flash on the back. Other review says power and volume buttons should be cut out but I disagree. It looks a lot sleeker with NO cut-outs on the side like it is part of the phone not just a case. Better that they are covered block out dust from getting in there. It is not hard to push at all. Just like pushing a regular button and my wife (different color case) also has no problem pressing the volume rocker or power button. Great buy for someone who wants the black look. I got a bunch of TPU cases on Amazon and Ebay and change them out frequently depending on my mood. This one is always part of the rotation. Not as thin as some of my other cases but that gives decent protection against the accidental fall. Also has a nice amount of grip not slippery. It does have a little thicker lip to protect the front of the phone (can be good or bad depending).

 review/text: I would recommend this case. It's secure for my phone, and I like that I can adjust the clip to be horizontal or vertical. The flap with the magnet is a little stiff when I want to pull out my phone, but I like that it is pretty secure. Can't beat the price, either!

 review/summary: great value
 review/text: I am very happy with this hands free device, though I've only used it for two days. For one, the price was right. The earpiece fits my ear fine and is comfortable enough; I talked continuously for 20 minutes and didn't even notice it. It's the same size as an average in-the-ear walkman-style earpiece. I have better clarity than using my cell phone directly. Also my cell phone gives me a headache and I don't seem to get that when I use this. (Hopefully I'll be cutting my chances of a tumor, as well!)

 review/summary: Not that great but it has it's uses
 review/text: I'm using a Motorala V60i with Verizon-wireless service so your experiences may vary.When I first bought this FM Stereo headset, I was hoping I could use it for listening to my favorite stations at work or during boring college lectures.I am very disapointed; I get nothing but static on this thing everywhere except when I'm in a open field. This thing is very sensitive to movement, which means using this while jogging is not a good idea, except if you want a really big headache from listening to static most of the time.This thing doesn't work well in most situations. If your planning on buying this thing to use in an office, in a moving car, in a classroom, while jogging, or pretty much in any situation. Don't waste your money. Instead buy a seperate mini AM/FM stearo headset which would work much better.However; the ear-piece and mic are outstanding. Crisp and clear calls when I'm using the headset. Then again I have only used Motorala headsets so my range of expertise is not all that wide.This thing is also pretty bulky and the wires get tangled faster than you can untangle them.The only two uses I found for this FM stereo headset are:1. listening to my fav radio stations while walking. Which has very little static, if I restrain from moving too much.2. Using this thing to drain the battery before recharging. Bought a new battery and Motorala batteries work best if you have full charge/discharge cycles for the first 3-5 charges.Even though the ear-piece and mic are outstanding, I can't stand the bulkyness of this thing. I use my plain and simple Motorala headset for all my hand-free wireless needs.If a Motorala Rep is reading this, all I have to say is put more into this thing to make it a great product. Put a stronger antenna and find someway to make it less cumbersome.Hope this review helps in your decisions.Thanks,Edrisk

 review/summary: Decent cheap phone but a little dissappointing on somethings
 review/text: Overall a decent cheap phone, however there are a few things that bother me.1) No external screen to see incoming caller ID and no external time display2) FM reciever is cool but it requires the headset to be plugged in to get reception so even if you want it on speaker the head set nedds to be available.3) The feel of the buttons are very numb, tough to tell if a button was actually pressed or not, not a big deal for dialing but in games it kinda sucks.4)Over all the phone has the awkward feel of the first in the RAZR series and really I don't like that, it's thin sure..but they make up for it in making the just a little too wide for my tastes.5) Reception is ok.... so far it is getting the same reception range my old v220 did with a cracked antenna. Not impressive for a phone that is a much newer release.Again these are just the things I was disappointed with and if these things don't bother you then I am sure it will make a good phone for you. But for me I was a little disappointed. It met my expectations but it certainly did not exceed them in any area.

 review/summary: Can't beat Samsung ..
 review/text: The very first phone I owned was a Motorola Startec, and it was one of the latest phones back then. I hated it, then I swicthed the phone company and got myself a samsung, and it was like I saw the light after a long dark night. Every function on that phone was very well designed.Now that I own D807 I am still pleased with its features and over all quality. My parents have Motorola razor, and I am telling you its the worst thing out there. The menus are not that simple to understand, the display looks like early 19th century CGA display.There few cons in this D807, that i will describe later. First the Pro's.Pro's:Sliding face plate is slick. My wife gets compliments everytime she goes out.I went to a ski trip recently, I didnt have my camera on me, so i took some pics using my cell phone, and I was surprised by the result. I was glad that I tried it. I also recorded a small video but dont know how to play it on my computer yet.Micro SD card option is great for transfering pics and video's.Shortcut buttons are the best, once you customize it to your use, you will never have to go thru those menu's again.Blue tooth is another plus, I use it to transfer pics to my PC, I share my phone book entries and pics with my wife.Voice dial is good, considering you dont have to train the phone first, which was the case in earlier samsung phones. Sometimes it doesnt work that good and it also depends on the names in your directory.Cons;The biggest con for me in this phone is the ring tones. I like the simple beep ones and they dont have one single tone of htat kind. All musical ring tones which I really hate.Another problem is reception. I have people in my office area who gets reception with other phones but i dont. Reception is a little poor on this phone.Unlocking the phone every time you have to use it, very annoying.There are not many options for display setting, specially the clock, it comes right on the center of your display pitcure.I have a slight problem with the micro SD card slot, it gets stuck when i nsert it and its really difficult to take it out. It doesnt slide out when I push it in again. I have to use tweesers and I am afraid that it my damage the phone.Over all I will recommend this phone for functionality and looks of it. I wish I could get the simple ring tones and better reception, I would give this phone 5 stars.

 review/summary: Great Phone When When It Works
 review/text: March 23, 2004. I have had mobile phones since 1981 when they first came out. Before this phone I was using a Nokia phone and Palm Tungsten. Bought this phone in December from AT & T Wireless. It worked great until the middle of February when the sound went out and I could only use the earpiece and speaker. I called tech support and they couldn't get it to work and they couldn't get me another phone for 12 days. The new one arrived and it would not hold a charge off the charger and would immediately perform a hard reset. I sent it back and received Treo phone 3 last week. Yesterday it too stopped working and I could only use it with the earpiece or on speaker. After researching on line, I discovered that this speaker going out is a real problem with the phone. I called At& T and they said that if I had bought any other phone from them they would replace it overnight. But they will not replace a Treo or Palm because of the PalmOne policy. So I am left with no choice but to order my 4th phone from Palm One and wait another 10 to 14 days for a replacement. And forget about getting one sent overnight by giving them your FedEx number. Their policy doesn't allow this.Features I have liked include: set up and Sim card exchange took only a few minutes; stronger reception (bars) than other Nokia or Sony Ericcson cell phones I have owned; email and web browsing works great; screen brightness and color are even better than the Tungsten that I had used for a year; talk time is excellent (I use 3000- 4000 minutes a month; very easy to use the Treo 600 with one hand; synchronizing and beaming works great;when phone works, it is probably the clearest cell phone that I have ever used; convenience of having one device is priceless. Dislikes: in addition to the reliability issues mentioned above, the camera is only fair and not as good as the fair one on the Sony Ericcson T616.April 13, 2004: (...)

 review/summary: Great pda/phone with lousy reception
 review/text: I have been an AT&T; customer for over three years. During that time I have had a Nokia phone, a Siemens phone and now this Handspring. I have never had a problem with reception until I started to use the Handspring. The only other complaint I have is that the camera on this phone stinks. It is much worse than the camera on other phones. My wife uses a Nokia with a built in camera and the picture she takes of the exact same thing I take turn out 100% better. Neither phone/camera reaches the quality of a stand alone digital camera, but the Nokie does produce some close copies under ideal circumstances. The Handspring does not even come close.Other than these two problems, the phone is incredible. The pda is a mini computer. I used an HP IPAQ for a couple of years and I loved it. I was not sure the pda of the Handspring would be able to replace my HP but it did. It is easy to use and intuitive. The keyboard is convenient and surprisingly accurate. The programs are helpful in organizing a busy life.After several months of use, I am pretty impressed with this pda/phone. My only wish would be for better reception.

 review/summary: Best PDA-phone available
 review/text: Early this year, I took the plunge and purchased the Samsung I330 PDA/Phone. After researching the various PDA/Phones out there, I came to the conclusion that this was the one I wanted. Overall I'm happy with my decision.Most of the PDA/Phones that I looked at seemed to come up short. Most appeared to be a phone with some PDA functions added as an afterthought or the other way around (one PocketPC/cell phone required a headpiece or you would not be able to place a call). The I330 is a usable PDA and a phone.The LCD is bright and readable, although somewhat dim in direct sunlight.However, there are some deficiencies. You cannot upgrade the version of Palm OS; You cannot download any customized ring tones; The case is awkward and opens up. Also, the hot sync utility sometimes goes CPU-bound and I have to kill it and restart to resync with Outlook.Even with those annoyances, it is great to get rid of my pager, cell phone and personal organizer. The phone quality is better than any other phone I have owned.The phone comes with an internet browser and I have used it to pull down street maps over the internet. It is slow, but useful.I'd highly recommend it to anyone.

 review/summary: Auto answer now bad...
 review/text: First the good:Small, fits my ear well over the ear (Jabra hurt me), cool looking. People think you are ultra modern with this blue light blinking. The auto answer is the best thing ever.The bad:Many times when the receiver answers they cannot hear me. I mean no sound at all, so I have to turn off the HS 820 and call back with the phone. I think there is a connection issue with certain receiving end phones. I also have had more dropped calls when using this unit. I had to change out this twice because of static sounds (not in the background but only with the callers voice)I upgraded my V710 phone software (to see if it would help) at Verizon and found that they changed the program to now make the phone ring and beep in my ear at the same time. I used to only get the beep in the ear to know that a call was coming (which was cool, when you did not want your phone to ring out loud) now I cannot stop the short ring on the phone so I have to change it to vibrate when using this item. The upgrade did not help with the problems I was having.So I advise you NOT to update your Verizon V710 if you don't have to.

 review/summary: works but too big and volume and reception is not great
 review/text: This device paired easily with my Motorola cell phone and also with my Gigabyte bluetooth USB device for my computer. However, the headset is too big for my ear so doesn't fit snugly. It tends to move around a lot and I'm afraid it will fall off. The first one I had had the microphone die within the first couple of days, so this is not a very resistant device. Also, when the volume in my ear is very loud and I turn the sound down, the person on the other end can't hear me anymore. Needs two separate volume controls, one for speaker and one for the ear. Overall, I'm not impressed. I am looking for a replacement.

 review/summary: Works but weak sound quality
 review/text: So far I have tested the hs805, hs820, hs850, and h500. The hs820 , just like the hs805, is pretty straightforward to operate, but unless it is a perfect fit for your ear, the sound quality and volume is poor. If you test it and it works for you, great, it is a dependable and easy to use unit. If not, I would put a little more in and get the hs850, h500 or h700.

 review/text: This is a very affordable bluetooth headset while we wait for the prices to start dropping. There are a couple problems. The first its hard to hook up if you have no idea what your doing. I brought it to a cingular store and they hooked it up in a second. The second problem is knowing how much power it has and when its going to die off. there really isn't any solution from my knowledge that can fix this but I don't really need this headset I just wanted it for home use.

 review/text: I got it for my motorola v551, read vv551 manual to figure out how to turn bluetooth on and to accept another device, when setting up headset you have to hold down button about 10 seconds for the light to turn on continuously the phone will then read and recognize it. when you turn th headset on the light will blink 3-4 times, you will see the bluetooth icon on your phone. works good when some parts of your home have poor reception I put the phone where I get good reception and walk around with the headset. you can keep the phone in your purse, keep the headset on (remember no wires) the phone will ring, you then tap the button onthe headset to answer the phone. I was talking on it in the grocery store yeasterday with my phone in my purse and people thought I was talking to myself, the only downside

 review/text: I will NEVER use my handset again. My new bluetooth earpiece has been a lifesaver. Never before did I realize how bound and limited I was when I had my handset. It is immensely better than a wired handsfree earpiece! I grocery shop with ease. I navigate the mall with shoes in both hands. The clarity of sound is wonderful. Callers have no problem hearing me. It is secure...I even bowled with it on my ear! I've carried on conversations in loud places where I wouldn't have even heard my phone in the past. You don't have a bluetooth earpiece yet?

 review/summary: Cant hear anything and people cant hear me
 review/text: This is a nice little Headset. Its small and light, you dont even know you are wearing it. But thats where the good things about it stop. The mircophone is not very sensitive, so when you talk to people, its a little difficult for them to hear you. Because of this, to get the voice dial to work, you have to yell the name at the Headset several times. Also the speaker is not very loud. When you are talking to someone else using this same Headset and you are also using this Headset you can hardly hear them and they can hardly hear you. This is because the speaker isnt very loud and the microphone isnt very sensitive, so it isnt very loud. Just bought a Plantronics M2500 Headset. While it is a little bit heavier and not as comfortable, the speaker and microphone are much better. The speaker is so loud, I dont even use it at the maximum setting, even when talking to someone that is using a Motorola HS820 Headset. Also the microphone is much more sensitive, people can hear me much better. They say I am much louder. I never have to say the name more than once in a normal voice with the voice dialing. The only thing with the Plantronics M2500 Headset is that you cant answer a call while on a call, which the Motorola HS820 Headset can do. Instead you have to answer through the phone instead. After using the Plantronics M2500 Headset for awhile I realize, its just not very comfortable. If I wear it for more than a few mins, it just starts to hurt my ear, also if you have small ears, it just wont stay on your ears. The design of the Motorola HS820 Headset is much more comfortable. I can wear it for hours and I dont even know its there. I am going back to using the Motorola HS820 Headset.

 review/text: I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!

 review/summary: Works great
 review/text: I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones, and therefore problems with the unit. It's my first bluetooth headset, but I couldn't be happier.P.S. People dissin' it because it doesn't work 25 feet from the phone or because it doesn't stay on your head when jogging? I guess I'm not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others...

 review/summary: Worked great for me. Awful for the person on the other end.
 review/text: This device is very compact and incredibly lightweight. It feels so much like a toy at first I thought I had purchased a display model by accident. Its' small size and presumably few internal components is also detrimental to its' performance. I used it for a week. Every caller said I sounded as though I was talking as normal. They would hear an echo of their own voice however, delayed a fraction of a second, which they found very annoying. A short term fix is to lower your earpeice volume, and you can see the downsides of that. Well, when my girlfriend is not happy then I'm not happy, back it goes. Sorry, Motorola, nice try though. If irritated callers are not a problem for you, then this is a great product. It's easy to sync, easy to use, and voice recognition works just as great with the headset as without (on my e815).

 review/summary: An Actual Sprint Tech Support Agent
 review/text: Well being a Sprint Tech Support Rep, I have become with all the familiar phones that Sprint has to offer. I am not going to be biased, just straight forward.PROS1. It can hold a 2GB micro SD card.2. You can get telenav services, for ten bucks a month, its GPS thats reliable and re-routes you if you miss your turn.3. Powervision capable. Speeds of max of 2 MEGS, but average of 400-700 KBPS.4. Its sexy, attention getter, and stylishCONS1. The slot for the memory card is in a horrible position. When I transfer music files, I like it stick the memory card in the adapter b/c the tranfer rate is fater than through USB.2. The music controls on the front are kind of sluggish.Other then that, its a good solid phone. It can basically do the same things as the RAZR, phone as a modem and you can watch live tv, but its just smaller.

 review/summary: Cool, but bulky!
 review/text: This is a cool cell phone case. I bought it to replace an worn case - but which I liked because it was not bulky. From the description, I did not know the product had a steel buckle. Take out the steel buckle, and replace it with a leather buckle that you can just slip into the belt as you wear it. The steel buckle is not only too bulky (and therefore protrudes a lot), it can slip off the belt...as it did recently and I dropped the cell phone, almost damaging it. You should design this product to not be dependent on belt width, which the steel buckle does. The design is awesome, but the steel takes away a lot!

 review/summary: may be too thin for certain users
 review/text: We got this phone when it first came out many months ago (really for my teenage daughter). The immediate problem I had with this phone was when I went to hold it (hands free) between my ear and shoulder it was extremely difficult and uncomfortable. You really couldn't used the phone that way for long without suffering a crick in your neck. I know the old adage about not being too thin but if you are accustomed to propping the phone without an ear piece then you are likely going to be miserable with this phone and shouldn't buy it. No wonder the phone manufacturer is pushing and bundling the bluetooth earpiece attachment because without it, forget it. I also have some trouble using to the buttons for dialing the numbers since they are so flat and feel different that you are not sure you are hitting the number unless you watch the numbers appear in the window as you punch them. There is also just the slightly longer pause let's say from the time you end or clear the last call and the time it takes for the phone to be ready to make the next one; if you start dialing the next call right away you may often find that the first number or two you pushed in the phone number didn't fully register so you need to start over the process of dialing the number again. If you're used to quick, reliabile dialing it can be another aggravating aspect of using this phone. Other than all that - it is a beautfiul, sleek, and sophisticated looking phone. It feels slick and sleek in your hand, not like most phones. It is also a really good size. I see many men especially having to go see-sawing the head from the ear to the speaker because some these new phones are so compact and tiny. Size length is really the best on this phone above most all others and should be the industry standard for ease of hearing and speaking. If you can deal with the problem of the "thinness" interfering with hands free use then I recommend the phone. I have had no problems with connectivity with this phone thru T-Mobile.

 review/text: I am a cingular customer and was totally bummed when I found out that I couldn't get this awesome phone from my provider. A lot of people online have been questioning why someone would get a phone from here for so much money when you can get one from T mobile stores, but if you are not a T mobile customer you need an UNLOCKED version of the phone to use it. All I had to do was put my old sim card in it and it worked! I have not experienced any problems at all with my phone so far. It works great and it is beautiful. It works great as a phone and the camera and video opions are fun. It also comes with software and a cable that connects to your computer so you can transfer songs and pictures to you cell, which is awesome. You can take any song and make it your ringtone for free! I would like to say that a lot of people complain that this phone isn't a great camera, mp3 player, etc...but those things are just for fun extras. Buy a digital camera or an i pod if you want all that! If you like style and pink this is the phone for you! The only complaint I have is that it took almost a month to arrive!

 review/summary: Nice phone
 review/text: It's a OK unlocked phone for me with good signal and battery standby time. I lost my phone before my contract term is full. I had AT & T and was worried if this phone would work. It turns out the phone works with my sim card. The speak phone is not that good but ha, for the price (I got it around $ 50-60) it is a worthy, functional phone. Only thing I'm concerned now is if this phone can last for a while as one of the reviews complained the phone died after 1 month.

 review/summary: a cheap item of the money paid
 review/text: The phone should come in with satin pink color for the cover. However, this phone has 4 different pink tones for different cover panels and the tone differences are so obvious. This made me feel that this is a phone which did not pass quality control from the original factory. The battery and charger are terrible. The original charger had 2 round legs for probably an Asian outlet and it came with a crooked adapter to convert it for the US outlet. In addition, the battery is constantly drained, if the receiving signal was not strong enough (compared to my Sony phone using the same SIM card). I have to recharge the unit every night even when the battery indicator is full --- since you never know when this thing will drained suddently. The cord for the ear phone is too short --- when I use it in my car, I have to put the phone on my lap. The ear phone quality is really bad and its operation is not as straight forward (handled by a single hand) as the Sony phone. Plus, the line is so easy to fall out of the phone to cut off the conversation. I no longer feel comfortable to use the ear phone while I am driving. This phone does not come with a manufacture warrantee, strange! Unfortunately, I did not have time to deal with all the problems in a timing manor after I received this phone. Otherwise, I would have returned it.The only good feature is the camera.

The product tag marks it as Michigan state, this means that all items in the inventory are mismarked.When I asked to speak to a higher up person so I could explaind the problem they said they would send an e-mail. I said I would keep the one I got and give it to a friend and that they could just ship the correct one, I would pay for the item they pay the shipping. they have no understanding of how to deal with a problem like this and I have no idea what is going on any thoughts? They told me to just reorder and see what happens. The item by the way is just fine and a good value for the $10.00

It is compact, stylish, and has a great microphone and also has a nice side addition which is the microphone's ability to filter out "ambient" noise, like wind, or the general noise caused by a car on the highway. People are completely unable to distinguish when I am holding my phone or when I'm on my headset in fact. I would recommend this unit to anyone in the market for a Bluetooth Headset.

 review/text: I have the super treker and unbelievably have had it for almost 2 years. This is the strongest little clip ever. I bought two just because I always break them and really liked the style of this one. Well the second one is just laying around ...somewhere. They include extra stickys, which is handy if you buy a new car or a new phone. And with the durability of this product I'm sure you will need them. If you have a silver phone this will match great with your phone. The attachment that sticks to your phone is small and all silver metal. Just super!!con...The only reason it isn't a 5 star product. The clip is a little tough to get used to. You will be fumbling a bit trying to get it off the clip. Definitely worth the extra effort to get it off when it is so sleek and unbreakable.

 review/text: I'm not sure I would buy another product with the Xcite name on it. I bought 2 of these. One for each car. I figured at the price I don't have much to loose. Well the first one wouldn't charge the headset making it junk. I'm a bit of a techy and was never able to figure out how to make the car unit work and the volume on the headset of the second one was far from loud enough. The positive side is that when I tried to return the defective unit, I was told by the shipper that it's not worth the shipping to return defective units and to throw it away. They then credited my account for full purchase price. I would not recommend this product. However, the shipper was fantastic.

 review/summary: Not the best phone...at all!
 review/text: For the first three months that I had the phone, everything was fine. But after three months, the volume just completely died! The alarm, the ring, the music player, everything. Now the sound works sometimes (it took three weeks for it to start working again and that was totally at random, nothing I did), but it's off and on. Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it goes in and out while it's ringing, sometimes normal, and sometimes just dead. And it's frustrating to not have external ringing volume control, although holding down the pound key will switch between silent and normal. Another problem is I could not get the voice activated controls to work. I'm sure they do, I just couldn't figure it out, and I've never had trouble using voice activated controls with any other phone I've had. Another problem I've had is that sometimes even when I have a signal, a call will just end for no reason. Granted sometimes I do accidentally hit the end call button, which is of course not a problem with the phone, but sometimes there is honestly no reason for it. Also, it has a pretty short battery life, so if that bothers you I recommend a Motorola as they tend to have long battery life (although be warned, in my experience Motorola phones tend to freeze and also do not typically have the signal quality of other phones). Another problem I've recently had with this phone is that the games on my phone stopped functioning properly. Also, this phone doesn't have as much memory as I would like, so that was disappointing. But fortunately it does have a micro SD card slot, and mine came with a card already in it. Finally, as for my phone background, whenever I try to use a picture I took myself as the wallpaper, it doesn't show up as "full screen" which is what the phone calls right side up. If there's a way to do it, I haven't found it!The pluses are that the external controls for the music player and radio are nice, although it'd be nice if you didn't have to plug in your headphones to listen to the radio. The stereo headset that came with the phone was nice too. The buttons were easy to use, and I like using this phone for texting.But when you weigh the pros and cons, for me this just isn't the right phone. I've had the phone 8 and 1/2 months now, and I'm looking for a new one. I usually try to keep phones for a year at least, but not this one. I was using my "back up phone" half the time after only 3 months of owning this phone, but I recently gave my back up phone to my sister. It's definitely time for a new one.

 review/summary: Feature packed, fun toy, good call reception, but plastic with a tough to remove back.
 review/text: I upgraded to the Nokia 5300 XpressMusic after three years of service with TMobile and a Motorola V300. Comparing the Nokia 5300 to the Motorola I noticed one huge difference right out of the box: Nokia is made of very lightweight plasic. This wasn't much of an issue until I went to change the SIM card out of the Motorola and put it into the Nokia. While I didn't break the back cover of the Nokia, it was a fear throughout the process. It's a very thin cover and since they are relatively cheap, I think I'll buy an extra one to have on hand just in case. I think the case on the Nokia is a bit on the delicate side, and you may want to consider a hard pastic cover (as sold on Amazon by Bargain Cell).A somewhat quirky design issue is the ON/OFF button. Not clearly identified in the documentation, it took me awhile to find it. (It's at the top of the phone near the USB and power inlets.) It's flush to the phone and although my fingers are small, it is tough to depress it. I have to use my nail or the end of a pencil to get it to work. Hold it for about two seconds and it will give you the option for 'Off' or several profiles such as 'normal', 'outdoor', etc. I guess if you don't turn your phone off, and keep it on standby, it's no big deal.Now for the good stuff, of which there is much to brag about with this phone. The camera: takes great shots, easily uploads to the computer for printing, fabulous zoom, and YES there's video with this phone!The music player is the big seller on this one, and doesn't disappoint. The 1GB card that it comes shipped with (installed) is enough for me right now, but I can tell I'll be upgrading to the 2GB card (about $24 on sale...) soon. Connecting to your PC through the included USB cord is simple and with XP, things pretty much recognized and synched without a problem. If you've navigated a cell phone menu and used a PC before, this shouldn't be a problem for you. Exporting video, images or music from your PC to the Nokia is very quick and easy.Another fun function is that once you've uploaded your tunes, you can set them to specific functions on your phone such as the incoming call ring. Easy to change and fun!The main reason for the phone: making and receiving calls. The Nokia seems to have a good antenna and where calls have been spotty with the Motorola, the Nokia has flawless reception. Volume control on the side is handy, as is the bluetooth and speakerphone, although I've yet to try them.Getting the earpiece just right to hear your caller may take some practice, but once you find the sweet spot, the calls are clear and the recipients say that the call quality on their end is excellent.A calendar, alarm, games (poker...one of my favorites), are all easy to find and use too.The display is clear, bright and LARGE! Beautiful screen. The size of the phone is no where as thin as a RAZR, but since I'm used to the V300, it's pretty much the same size and a bit lighter in weight.The slide on this phone is smooth, but since I'm new to this design I have no comparison. I hope it holds up as well as the flip design, but I would imagine that depends upon me. "Gently" would be the key word when using this phone.A rubberized grip (the color) is on the side and back of the phone. Volume control, fwd, rwd, pause, play and camera buttons are on the side with the camera lens on the back of the phone.This is a fun phone with many options. It was 'free' with a 2yr contract re-up on TMobile.com, and the SIM card can go back into my V300 if for some reason durability is an issue down the road. I think as long as you are careful with your Nokia 5300 XpressMusic phone, it will keep you smiling for some time to come.

 review/summary: Great phone for a non-techi.
 review/text: I bought this phone upon deciding to switch to T-mobile from Verizon. I wanted a phone with a user friendly music player that I wasn't required to purchase individual songs for if I didn't want to. I was able to use the player without having to purchase any additional software for my computer. It is compatible with Windows Media as well as Yahoo Music(which you can also purchase a subscription to.) It is a my faves phone, which is also a big plus. It is also IM enabled.If you are into messaging, it has some nice features. It is capable of taking video and voice message clips. The camera is nice also, with a large screen. You can type in your message and the phone will predict what word you are typing, so you don't have to punch each button 2 or three times. Just type the word and the phone will guess what word you want.The phone is blue tooth enabled and comes with a usb cord, ear plugs and an adaptor piece. There are many other features that I don't understand, but someone who is good with technology would have no problem understanding.To sum things up, this is a phone with a lot of features. It isn't too advanced that a person can't eventually figure out how to use most of them, even if you are used to a basic phone like I am.

 review/summary: Makes the RAZR look like The Nutty Professor!
 review/text: This is, hands down, the thinnest phone on the market right now. If you put it next to the RAZR, you will wonder how you ever thought the RAZR was thin. Not only is this phone slick and stylish, it functions great too. It has everything you'd expect, plus more. Camera, video, voice recorder, mp3 player, internet, email, even applications like calculator, stopwatch, currency converters, etc. It supports Java games and applications. You can even view txt/word/pdf documents (although they require a lot of zooming and panning to be readable on the small screen). The sound on this phone is top notch. The speakers are crystal clear and super-loud. Speaker-phone works great. And the included headphones are nice quality (even better than the stock iPod headphones). Overall it does everything you would need a phone to do and does it with style.But who cares what the phone does when it looks this sexy? The design of the phone is very nice. The buttons actually feel like real buttons (unlike those esoteric designs on the Motorolas). The screen is bright and crisp, not blurry like most phones. The menus look nice, clean design and are easy to navigate. Everything about this device is quality. Bottom-line, this is the phone that James Bond would have. You will not be disappointed.

 review/text: Still trying to figure out why you would list something on Amazon and not put a pic in the product details. It is 2/27/12 and still no pic. I ordered this a week ago. I received it about 4 days after I ordered it, not too bad. This looks like the horizontal hybrid cases that are advertized on the Amazon site. I went with this company because I have bought from them before and know they have quality cases. I also bought a tri color case from them for my ATT Galaxy Note 717 and this fits more nicely but both are great cases. You can see the color of your phone in half of the back. I think I should have gotten the white or clear but it is functional so I will keep it no regrets.

 review/summary: Rugged case, great if you wear a belt
 review/text: The case fits the 810i a little tight in the first few days, but after some usage, it stretches out and the phone fits well. There are cut outs for most buttons and especially the walkman and circular menu button in the center. The clear plastic is thin enough that all the number keys can be pressed easily.Sometimes you might have a problem pressing the Walkman button on the front left. There is also no cut out for the memory card (not a big deal if you use a 1 GB card).Can be charged without taking out of case, Camera can also be used without taking out of case by opening up the buttons on the back. But the usage is a little cumbersome as you have to make sure the flip lid does nt obscure the lens view while taking a shot. This case is a MUST to protect the camera lens. The camera is pretty good, but if only Sony had added a lens lid then can do away with the case. The case adds bulk to an elegant phone!

 review/summary: Works Good Enough for Me, Except the Voice Command Part!
 review/text: This review is for;Motorola H700 Bluetooth HeadsetI had this Bluetooth for over two years now and I have been very satisfied with it. I got a Bluetooth in response to California's mandatory hand's free law while driving. I only use this Bluetooth when I'm driving. The unit fits real well to my ears. If I get a call it beeps and I press it once to answer & once to hang up. Simple! I can also press the unit once to redial. My only complaint about this unit is the voice commands don't exactly work perfectly for me. As a Filipino-American I have a lot of ethnic names in my phone's directory so if I use voice commands on my Bluetooth to call a name with a complex pronunciation it often attempts to calls someone else in error. I suppose if my phone directory had simplified names like "home", "work" or "school" I would probably use my voice commands more frequently. Not sure if the voice command is just an issue with my specific phone the LG EnV, but for now I just keep it simple and only use the Bluetooth for answering the phone or re-dialing while driving so my hands can be kept on the more important task of driving safely.

 review/text: I enjoy this headset. It's easy to use, it was easy to set up with several different cell phone models, it's got great sound clarity, lightweight, ear piece fits comfortably on either side. It has static when it's on low charge as oppose to not functioning at all. I enjoy the hands free calling with voice commands.

 review/summary: Pretty good overall
 review/text: I just got this phone about 2 weeks ago. It's pretty easy to use. Voice quality is acceptable. Battery life is terrific. But my favorite feature is the blue lighting on the hinges/sides of the phone. I like this feature because it draws attention to the phone when in use and is just straight-out cool. It's lights are not as good as the previous T-Mobile phone that I had (The Siemens CF62T, which also has lighting effects, except they are around the rim of the keyboard) but it works. Overall, this phone is pretty good. Can take a beating, easy to learn functions/features, fair quality camera, and frigging sweet dynamic lights.

 review/summary: First Blackberry... I was also changing carrier.
 review/text: Before I order this phone through Amazon, I went to a local store to see it first. I recommend this, because you can feel, see and test the phone to see if you like it. I really like the pearl and this is my first Blackberry. There are many new things to learn about the pearl and I am finding new things about the pearl everyday. The sure type takes a while to get use to. I love the size, weight and the vivid colors of the screen. The phone is compact, so if you have big fingers, it would not work out. You will also need to purchase a separate Mirco SD memory card if you want to upload MP3 songs and ring tones or take pictures etc... More updates to come about the phone.Pearl is 5 stars.As for T-mobile service. The service is great and the customer service is really good. I was switching from another carrier and I wanted to keep my number. When you sign a new contract, Amazon gives you a preset phone number. What I did is, I called T-mobile and they were able to switch over and I was able to keep my old number. If there was something that a consumer wants, T-mobile will do their best to accommodates.T-mobile is 5 stars.

 review/summary: Best Nokia I have EVER owned
 review/text: I previously owned a 3650 (with the round keypad) so I have been very used to typing on a very small keypad. I just love this phone... The major reason that the keys are small is because the phone is small. The keypad and screen are interconnected and slide into the metal body of the phone (which is smaller than other slider phones I have seen like the Samsung). The screen is like a HD TV producing something like 275,000 colors. I have a Bluetooth connection through my laptop and after installing the Nokia CD ROM onto my computer and linking the two together (which was very easy) I sent one of my favorite photos to the phone, setting it as my wallpaper which is gorgeous. The software lets you send music and backup phone numbers and data from your phone to computer and visa versa. The call quality is exceptional, and the WAP internet is very fast. The 8801 also has some type of 3D engine built into the OS, which helps to produce amazing imaging. Battery life is somewhat less than I am used to, however, after letting the battery drain dead and then recharging for 24 hrs. (using the backup provided rotationally) I have actually been getting 3 hrs of talk time as suggested. One last thing that I love about the phone aside from that fact that it looks amazing and the OS is very easy to navigate (as are all Nokia's) is that the phones SAR's rating for tissue radiation from a cellular device is one of the lowest of any phone at .45 which is personally important to me (the federal limit is a little under 2). I hope this helps any potential buyers make a decision, because I am very happy with mine!

 review/summary: Great phone but don't be afraid to get it replaced one or twice
 review/text: I bought this phone when it first appeared on amazon for slightly over six. The price has actually gone up and needless markup (neimanmarcus) sells it for nine; however, t-mobile sells for 550 but w/activation 2yr contract. I would stick with amazon because of their return policy.The phone uses the 850/1800/1900 frequencies so you can use it as a world phone. (The Nokia 8800 supports 900/1800/1900 so you can use anywhere or the USA with t-mobile fyi.) You'll need the 850 to use it in the states w/any GSM provider other than t-mobile and I *beleive* cingular). The 8801 has great Nokia reception as do all of their phones I've used...while people around you in an elevator drop calls normally yours hangs on.It's important to have a firmware of at least 3.78 checked by typing *#0000# or you may get a rebooting problem seen in comments. Some of those problem could also be from not using the battery lock that swivels to make sure the battery stays down. The one thing understated about the 8801 is that it comes with a 2yr warranty with overnight service and a special number to call that will not make you wait to talk to a person, which is awesome if you ever call it. I've sent mine back because of the slide breaking and it's a painless experience.The feature set is rich even having strange things like a programmable RFID tag! The browser is fairly useless so download mini.opera.com, plusmo and for instant directions, the free google mobile gmaps is a must when you're sick of 800555tellme not understanding you. Additionally you can run any J2ME apps for AIM, MSN messenger etc. You can make free skype (for 2006 usa-to-usa) calls using www.soonr.com from the 8801 or any phone, which is awesome. And, you can change the look by grabbing free themes (use 8800 ones) via phone.mobile9.com. Try the macintosh themes, very good.Syncing it up to my PC at work was a snap with Nokia's office suite installed and it beeps every time I have a meeting, which reminds me to get coffee. You can nit the right arrow ? and check your schedule on the go, too.It's an expensive phone no-doubt but I use it for a home phone & cell so I wanted something nice and sturdy. It works great with Bluetooth devices and even streams music to headphones. I have my mac set to download the latest podcast and bluetooth it to my phone for the commute ride listen.Battery life isn't THE best but it's not vomit. Plug it in at nite and if you have an extra charger, plug it in at work... problem solved.The `scratch less' screen is great, the speakerphone works well, the voice tags work well with the supplied ear fob. I really like this phone and recommend it, highly.

 review/summary: The right phone for the right reasons
 review/text: For some reason this phone seems to be generating a lot of controversy in reviews, often, I feel by those who haven't even used it.I've had my 8801 for about 2 months now, and I can say with full confidence that it's the best phone on the market... for me.If you're looking for all the newest whiz-bang features, this phone is not for you.If you're looking for a sensible price to performance ratio, it's not for you.If, however, you're looking for a phone that functions falwlessly as a phone (Great reception, great sound quality, fantastic user interface) and like the feel of a solid slider style phone, then it could be the phone for you.I hada nokia 8890 for almost 5 years before it finally died, and untill the 8801 came around - nothing filled it's shoes, now I have a phone that does exactly for me what the 8890 did, works great and just feels right to use.I do feel that a few flaws should be addressed though. The battery life is miserable (but it comes with a 2nd battery that fits perfectly in the little 5th pocket in your jeans). The fancy ringtones are a bit silly. and the Ring volume is a bit lacking.All in all it's still the perfect phone for me - and I really don't care if anyone else notices it.

 review/summary: Perfect for me.
 review/text: All I look for in a phone is how it looks, how small it is, and how fast it is (browsing address book, deleting messages, going through menues). The 8801 does this perfectly considering it is a Color phone.Phones were getting smaller and faster. The best example is the 8890 which I owned for 3 years. That phone has no lag when you erase messages or browse menues. I was so happy with this "small and fast" trend and then came the slow color phones. Not only that, but soon followed the camera phones.With this color and camera phone combination, cells started to increase in size and functions. Speed, however, was not given much of interest. All they wanted was to print spec sheets showing how many actions a particular cell phone can perform.Well I AM HAPPY to say that 8801 does none of this nonesence. It does have a cammera, but it takes horrible pictures which I dont care about (I actually rather the phone not having one). This phone is exactly what I was looking for. Its the 8890, but color version.If you want a FAST, BEAUTIFUL, HEAD TURNING phone then this is it.Nokia warrants this phone for two years and you will find a special number on the warranty manual of your phone. If soemething ever goes wrong with your 8801, just call that number and you wont have to wait to get answered. Explain the problem and you get your phone shipped overnight.Nokia not only did great on this phone, but also providing Customer Service for it.The ONLY drawback so far I've had is everyone wanting to take a look at my phone when I take it from the puch to talk to someone. It really stands out from the croud.When people see bulky phones, they will ask you how many MP the camera has and if you can go online and what things have you downloaded... When they see an 8801, they want to TOUCH it, SEE it really closely, and ask you how much it costed. I guarantee this is the only phone out there (except for VERTU phones) that catch this type of attension.Yes, theNokia 8801 is expensive, but its perfect. Materials used and design of the think is far beyond any other phone. Same as Ferrari, yeah they charge a LOT for them, but is a masterpiece joined by carbon fiber and all those expensive extra gadgets you dont see from outside the car.

 review/summary: Great phone but does take some getting used to
 review/text: I've had this phone for about a week now and have had a chance to try out all the features except for the Bluetooth headset feature (since I don't own a Bluetooth headset). I must say that I really like this phone, but it does have some facets that take some getting used to. Some of the highlights of my experience so far are...Look and Feel:The look and feel of the camera are absolutely top-notch. The phone, as others have noted, has a very good weight to it. The phone isn't heavy, but it's definitely there and it feels substantive. It is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but not any more than other shiny accessories like my PSP and black iPod. A couple of wipes with the included pouch takes care of all the fingerprints (the pouch is made out of this synthetic suede-like material which drags across the phone with a bit of resistance and wipes away all the fingerprints very easily).The charger dock is tre cool as well. The base of the dock has this "ground effects" blue LED that cycles in and out of lumination when plugged in. Very soothing, very cool.Techy stuff:Voice quality of the phone is very good. I can hear callers clearly and they me. Not much else to be said there.The phone comes with a suite of software which enables you to synchronize contacts (only using the phone's memory, not SIM card memory), upload music and wallpapers, and make backups of the content on the phone. All this can be done via Bluetooth, so if your computer has Bluetooth capability, you don't need to buy any additional cables or kits. This is my first phone that I could update via PC, and I have to say, I will never go back to updating things within the phone again.I do not have a data plan with this phone (that's what my Blackberry is for) so I didn't check out the web browser at all.Cons:The only minor negative I have about this phone is the keypad. As others have noted, the keypad is a bit small, especially the navigation keys. I found that I ended up pressing the 2 key when trying to scroll down quite a few times. This was especially annoying the first two days or so; however, after a week of using and playing with the phone, I've gotten completely used to the size and layouts of the keys. When you first use this phone, I'm pretty sure that you'll be annoyed by the keys, but I'm also sure that you'll get used to it within no time.All in all, a very nice phone all across the board.

 review/summary: expensive toy for the rich and clever, I'll explain ;)
 review/text: First of all, I see a lot of hate reviews here from people who doesn't even own the phone. Some negative points made by other who own the phone are true;-we should get more from a 'top-notch' phone-the phone it replaces (8890i, 8890) brought new features, this phone simply does not-might have been a little bit lighter (138gr.)-attracts finger prints but they are not a huge problem as they are being made out in some of the reviews, pouch provided takes care of them perfectlyBut there is a big catch at this point where I say the phone it replaces; DO NOT expect to see proce cuts on this phone such as the RAZR, this phone will always be exclusive. From what we've seen in the past (8810, 8890, 8910i), this is for sure. 8890i still sells for 550$ new.If you are a person like me who changes phones like socks, you know how important this is. As the time goes on, the phone you bought 9 months ago gets old, the DESIGN gets old, you start to see it everywhere. It just does not feel exclusive anymore. Before this phone I owned S700, which I paing 649$ (same prove I paid for my 8801 now), 8 months later the price is now down to 379$ and it lost its exclusivity as SonyEricsson started to use the same design with other phones. Same thing goes for RAZR, almost 1 out of 4 phones are RAZRs out there! Because the price is now down to 200$.My plan is to keep this phone for at least 3 yrs., I bought it from CompUSA with their 2yrs. extended warranty, so if anything goes bad they replace it with a new one. They DO NOT try to fix the problem, they just change it with a new one or with a phone at the same class if they don't have the 8801 anymore. The price is 599$ and the 2 yr. warranty is around 65$. It is also possible to extend the warranty when it expires.It is a pretty clever buy at this price if you think about the time period you will be using it. Whatever happens, I will have this phone for a long period of time, I also have a mpx220 which I use for its more advanced features(Windows Mobile 2003SE), these 2 make a perfect couple in my opinion :)In summary, this phone is a good choice for a person who cares more about the looks than the features. This phone will surely last for years. It is a good investment for people who can afford

 review/text: I am very disapointed. I ordered this for a lightsaber holder. After I put my saber in a few times, it fell apart. It should not have done that. Also it came in a little plastic bag, and not a plastic bubble case. Also it was all black, with no white. I am forced to keep this because I have no money to send it back and no way to currently do so. I am very sad and dissapointed and say you should not buy this. If there quality control is that bad, then why bother buying.

 review/summary: Great Headset!
 review/text: I've had my headset for about 9 months, and it is almost the perfect headset. I use my cell phone as an office phone, and this headset is the best I've heard for sounding like a land line. I've had a number of people express surprise that I'm talking on a cell phone. It even sounds this good in a car and outdoors. I think this is because the mike is very close to the mouth, and the foam padding eliminates wind sounds.The battery life is very good. I've used it for several hours a day without it losing its charge, and I usually charge it only 2-3 times a week, since I've heard this helps the battery.It doesn't drop signals, and I rarely have to reconnect it during the day after several hours of non-use.Volume is also very good, and no static, even working in an office with 3 computers and other equipment.So what's not to like:The construction of the headset doesn't lend itself to being carried arounding your pocket, because it's too bulky for that, and it will damage the forceps action, so they don't open when you press the rocker switch. You can still open them, but not conveniently. So I use a different, compact headset for carry around purposes. If that works for you, and you need excellent sound when using a cell phone, then I recommend this one for you.BTW, I like mine enough that I'm getting another, so I don't have to mess with the ear forceps manually anymore.

 review/summary: Great phone
 review/text: I have had this phone for about 2 weeks now, and I love it. It's simple, but it has a few extras on it to make it worth it. There is no camera...which I have had a camera on my phone for several years now, so I kind of miss it. But in all actuality, I rarely used it before anyway. The buttons are kind of small, but I had a razr before this so I am used to smaller buttons. You can change your navigation buttons to be what you want them to be. I wish I could check my myspace on this phone, but its not myspace enabled. I also have issues checking my gmail. Most other email services are good though (hotmail, yahoo, etc). All in all, I knew this phone had no camera and I knew the buttons were small before I ordered it. The ONLY major problem I have is, when I got the phone it had a dead pixel on it...but I know Cingular can send me a new phone. Great phone!

 review/summary: Samsung isn't the best line of phones, but this one is amazing.
 review/text: I have had two Samsung phones in the past that both have extrememly angered me. Samsung is NOT a good line of phone but I had no choice in buying this phone [as I am sixteen and under my parents line -- haha] but I really like this phone so far.The camera couldn't be better. The pixels work well and it's great. Very bright and easy to use.The reception is perfect. Even with Verizon [which angers me as well -- you can never hear anybody] the sound is excellent. I haven't had a dropped call yet.The design is very sleek and appealing. I love the easy to press buttons and how easy it is to find everything you need.The pre wall papers are very aesthetic and good. Text messages come in quick, voice mail is great, etc.Sure the battery life isn't great but they even say that in the description so if you wanted a long one, should have bought one. I charge my phone constantly anyway, I have yet to have it die on me. The talk time is only about three hours but I'm usually indoors and so the charger is easy reach. When charging and talking at the same time, the reception is still good.It smudges a little too easily, but that's easy to fix.This sleek flip phone is perfect for jean pockets.I highly recommend this phone, one of the better samsung products. The only problem is that I have only had the phone a few short days and I'm not sure how it will act up later. I will keep everyone posted though =]

 review/summary: I love this case! The best for a Z22.
 review/text: I bought this case after having purchased the PALM 3257WW Palm Z22 Everyday Case a year ago. I quit using my Z22 because I got tired of having to zip open the case and take out the Palm to use it. It was also too bulky. This case is SO much easier to use because you can use the Z22 just by flipping up the cover. It's also a little bit slimmer. It looks a lot nicer than my other case. I ordered it from SF Planet and received it in 3 days, just as promised. A great buy!

 review/summary: Best one so far - and at a cheap price
 review/text: I have tried so many earbud/earpieces for my mobile phone. Of them all, this is the best. The piece goes right into the ear (with no complicated around the ear loops) - it stays there (you get different gels to fit ear hole). The sound is good on both ends... I find that it lasts about a year - (I have bought three for myself over the years); the earbud eventually gets detached.... but, for the price and product, if I got a couple of months out of it I would be glad. Definite buy!

 review/summary: sound locks up
 review/text: I got the H350 for my wife thinking that the two H505s I've had were so great that I couldn't go wrong, even though it was cheaper. I was wrong. She was telling me that she would answer the phone and there would be no sound and there was nothing you could do to talk to the other person. She kept having this problem periodically and I thought it was just her, so i traded her my 505 for it. I had the same problem. It would work for several calls, then I'd answer the phone and there would be no sound. It wouldn't let me transfer the sound to the phone, and if I turned it off, it would still beep when a call came in. The only cure was to turn the headset off, then shut the phone off, and on again. It was somehow taking over control of the phone to the point where i couldn't disconnect it. I sent it back to Motorola for a replacement, (their customer service is excellent by the way) but the replacement does exactly the same thing. Two different types of phones also, she has a Nokia and I have a Sony Ericsson. It's just not worth buying for the frustration you'll get from it. I've had two 505s and an 850, and the 505 was the best. There are issues with background noise interference, and I had trouble getting the voice dialing to work except when in a quiet environment, but the 500 series is an excellent and extreemely comfortable piece.

The price of this product if far below the similar products found at the cell phone carriers. Great buy!

I find it comfortable enough that I forget I'm even wearing it. I have some issues with clarity in a few spots, but if I hold my phone closer to the headset in the fuzzy spots, it's okay... and that's not in a lot of places, just happens once in a while. It's easy to pair with any phone too. I used to have a motorola and recently switched to a Samsung. It paired up with no problem. I recommend this product. It's a great place to start if you're looking for your first bluetooth.

 review/text: Before I made this purchase I read all of the negative reviews. Then I went to my local electronics outlet and looked at their equivalent. Locally the price was $10 for pretty much the same item.I purchased this item from Amazon's seller and hoped for the best. I was not disappointed. The ear bud arrived and had the Motorola logo and the sound was perfect. I have no idea why there would be static on the buds, as reported by several users, but that was not a problem with mine.All in all, price, quality and quickness of shipping, I certainly recommend this ear bud to anyone who needs a 2.5 plug for their cell phone's ear piece connector.

It can charge while the computer is on, or it can charge with a separate charger. It does not have a holder for a sylus, which would be helpful.

 review/summary: Cheap, but good quality and durable
 review/text: I guess not so many people would consider buying anything like this unit since a regular charger is more than enough usually. Well, one of the Razr's in my house could not longer charge the battery within the cell phone. This put me on the market to search for a unit like that. By the way, I tried different battery as well and different phones with no luck, so I really had to charge the battery externally.When this unit arrived, I quickly realized that this is SO MUCH BETTER than the regular charger, b/c it shows the battery level accurately, while charging, while my cell phones (both) don't do that. It also looks a lot more nicer on the desk or over visible place than a crappy generic charger. All-in-all, I now can charge a battery and the second cell phone. I used it for about a year now and it still works.The only downside it is NOT dual voltage, 115V only - so it will not work, while traveling to Europe or other 220V country.

 review/summary: Believe the Hype
 review/text: First of all. The Treo technology is, as the other reviewer commented, a PDA first. It is on a push/pull technology. If you don't log off of the internet (that does not mean ending the internet session by closing the phone or pressing end) then your phone will continue and remain online. You must log off. That is where those $1000 + bills come from. The treo uses a 1x/and broadband technology, which is the among fastest wireless technology in the country. It is faster than your home dial up. Yes you can use the treo just along with your regular plan, but if you got one of the megabyte 1x plans it will be alot faster when browsing the internet. Those plans are 24.95 for 5 mB and 44.95 for unlimited. that is unlimited internet access and downloading etc. I pay more for my home computer internet and I gotta stay in one place with that. I also recommend the Verizon Wireless Treo, because the coverage area is so much greater than any other carrier. Not only does verizon cover more that anyone else, (including Cingular and At&T combined), but they have more towers than any other company. The Treo as a phone has camera speaker phone, stylist and a letterpad. It is smaller than most PDA phones but has a screen that is just as big, if not bigger. The people who I have talked to who also have the phone have hardly had any issues at all with it. It is the highest selling Verizon Wireless PDA phone. There is a reason for that.

 review/summary: Neat phone, unfortunate reception
 review/text: I guess I just wasn't meant to have this phone... I originally purchased it from cells[...]It's a neat phone, especially the video functionality that lets you pick different color filters, even a negative filter.I chose the unlocked version thinking I'll have more versatility for travel. However, this means that you have to call T-Mobile to download t-zones so you can send and receive picture and video messaging. It also means, most annoyingly, that you won't get the usual icon to let you know you get voicemail - instead empty text messages _@ lets you know someone left you a message and delta@ lets you know you've checked your voicemail.Unlike the phone from cellswholesale, amazon did send me a new phone, with the tamper sticker on the box and the protective plastic on the phone. Whereas cellswholesale's phone was for the Chinese market with a Chinese adaptor, amazon's was for Hungaria and Romania, so there was no English handbook. I went online to motorola's website and made the mistake of downloading the upgrade software for the phone hoping the voicemail notification would work. (It didn't work - it only erased a lot of the extras for the European market). Extras also included the PhoneTools 4.0 software with USB connector, which I unknowingly purchased separately.It's still a neat phone - but the reception is HORRIBLE. Everyone I speak to sounds like they're congested with a really horrible flu and I miss out on over half the conversation. I'm with T-mobile in Northern Jersey and this reception is way worse than for the Nokia phone I had for over 3 years. Also small things I preferred about my Nokia phone was how it placed an icon on the screen to let you know you set the alarm and also Nokia let you know how much time was left before the alarm time. And yes, you need tweezers to remove the SIM card from the Rizr. You can set an analog watch on the lower right, but it's hard to read.It's too bad I'm returning the phone to amazon. I love the way it feels - solid and compact and its smart multimedia features. It also has an easy-to-use voicedial program. If it wasn't for the terrible reception, I would keep it, but then again, what's a phone for?

 review/summary: The best for Nextel users
 review/text: I rate this phone the best for a Nextel user due to it's slim size. I've had mine about a month and am really enjoying not having to strap a phone the size of a brick to my hip.This phone is essentially a 730 slimmed down. It seems the space savings was achieved with a slimmer battery - because mine does need recharging about once per day.I've used the 1000,85,95,73 and now this phone. I prefer a slimmer design over battery life. If you don't mind returning to a charger every so often you'll probably like it. If you are away from a power source and on the phone for a while you will need a spare battery or two. UPDATE 3-29-05: Still enjoy using this phone. The small size and solid construction has worked very well for me. If you're thinking Nextel and want a compact phone I'd definitely look at this model.

 review/summary: A Great PDA/Phone Combo!
 review/text: I have been using PDA's since 1997 and so far this has been one I have used to date. The integration of the phone with the PDA allows me to carry just one device instead of two. The XV6600 is not much bigger than my most current PDA, the HP iPAQ 2215, so to me, it feels fine in my pocket.This does not have wi-fi, but has not been a problem since I also purchased Verizon's EVDO wireless data service. I have to say that the Internet has been fantastic!! It's faster than dialup and not much slower than my home DSL connection. So the lack of wi-fi has not been a problem for me. I purchased the combined voice and data package for $79.99 a month and includes 450 minutes on the voice plan. It seems a bit pricey, but I have a corporate discount of 20% of the plan, so it makes the monthly payment a little more bearable.Also, the Bluetooth radio has been working great. I have been able to pair it up with no problem to my Plantronics BT320 headset and my Navman 4410 GPS receiver at the same time.The one thing I would recommend getting is Microsoft Voice Command 1.5. It makes the whole experience much more enjoyable!! The only problem is that it does work through my Bluetooth headset since the device itself does not support it.Phone quality has been pretty good. I will say that the volume on the speakerphone and the headset are a little bit on the low side, but not so bad that I can't hear it. I would recommend that you try this first before purchasing.Overall, I love the XV6600 and would highly recommend it to anyone.

 review/summary: Comfortable is an understatement!
 review/text: This is the most comfortable headset I have ever worn. I wear it for ten hours a day, five days a week. I work in a noisy environment so I wear noise reducing earmuffs. The earmuffs fit comfortably and seal over the headset with just the boom protruding. I wear glasses and this headset does not interfere with them at all. The only downside to this headset is the dongle control module. The answer button is not recessed enough and it is easy to bump the button and hang up on people. I glued a plastic washer around the button and I don't have that problem anymore. If they got rid of the dongle all together and just had an answer button on the headset, this would be the greatest headset ever made (IMHO).

 review/summary: Warning: Don't Change Plans with T-Mobile!!!
 review/text: First of all, the Samsung phones are nice, but they ALL have a problem with the display not working after about one year. Just after the warrenty stops. I would suggest that if you are extra careful when you close your phone, it will probably prolong the life of the display. But I digress. I had the previous S105 model and the display went bad about 16 months after I purchased it. I had the 1000 minute T-Mobile plan for 9 months, and then I dropped down to the $10 cheaper plan for one month, and then went back to the 1000 minute plan for the past 6 months. When the phone went bad, I asked T-Mobile what they could do, and since the phone was out of warrenty, they offered a new phone which I did not like for $50 out of my pocket. I had the bright idea that I could order a new phone from Amazon for basically free, and have a replacement Samsung and still come out ahead. When I went to cancel the current contract, T-Mobile told me that I was still under contract for six months. When I switched back to the 1000 minute plan, it started my contract time all over again. They wanted to charge me $200 to terminate the contract. I spent 20 minutes complaining to the supervisor, and she offered to reduce the termination fee to $100, which I had to accept since I would be paying for two phones. Apparently, they consider the 1000 minutes to be a promotional plan, and they had the right in the small print to not give me credit for being a T-Mobile customer for the past 16 months on a 12 month contract. I have never had this problem with Sprint before and I was very upset that T-Mobile would treat their customers in this way. I have written a letter to their customer service asking for a refund, but I have had no response to my letter, which is also a major disappointment to me that they could not even acknowledge the they even received my letter. So if you purchase a T-Mobile phone, DON'T CHANGE YOUR SERVICE or else you will be responsible for a new 12 month contract the second you make the change. The phone is a great deal, and if you handle your phone carefully, and don't change your service, you will come out ahead. I fault T-Mobile for NEVER telling me when I made the change in service that a new contract would be starting, and they should be like other carriers that don't care if you change plans as long as you stay a customer. Shame on you T-Mobile!

 review/summary: Tmobile & this phone make for a painful experience
 review/text: Save your money. Even if these rebates are true. Whoever you have as a cell carrier, even if your using an 80s style brink phone - your getting better service. Yes this phone is filled with fun colored crap. But even that becomes a problem. This phone likes to stop and think. Often it will take up to 4 seconds after you open the flip for it to 'wake up'. On top of this you'll start pressing buttons, and nothing will happen for 4-5 seconds and it'll finally start doing soemthing. Its not just my phone. Other people I know have the same problem with this model. I live on the northside of Chicago, and have to go outside to use my phone to get an acceptable quality to understand anyone. I can't tell if this is t-mobile or the phone, all I know is that t-mobile bought voicestream, which was known as the worst carrier in the nation. It seems they haven't improved muched.

 review/summary: Flip Phone wary
 review/text: I have purchases a few flip phones in my life and have alway had issues with cracking at the joint. Well this was no exception. I am not a power user, nor do I drop my phone, but it cracked, in the same place as my business partners, who also owns the same phone. We took it back to T-mobile within 4 months of service and because it wasn't a software glitch, they said they would replace it for $75.00. Not my idea of a warranty at all. Too bad, because it does have some nice features.

 review/summary: Great compact phone
 review/text: I brought this after using several Nokia's. The software and the ease of use is not as great as the Nokia's but boy this phone is just great. I switched from AT&amp;T and the service in the Silicon Valley is just great. The best way to enter the telephone #'s is to use the pc and the web and xfer it to your phone. It beats the hell out of me as to why T-Mobile sends everything as a mobile #'s but there is a way you can change it by using the &quot;Copy&quot; command. I have tried it and it works.The biggest problem that I have is that the ring+vibrate don't work together. Other than a few minor issues, I love this phone, it is quite compact the sound is great (a little bit of static could be heard) and the T-Mobile service is great. People complain about this phone before actually getting used to the various ways of doing things. I wish Samsung makes it a little bit more logical and intutive. This phone not a bad idea at all.

 review/summary: good midline phone
 review/text: I got this phone in the end of December. My previous phone was the similarly-sized Motorola v66. All in all, this phone is about the same as that one. Reception seems to be good and the ring and voice volumes are superb. the color screen is a very welcome change. The only gripe that I have is that it doesn't have all the nice features of some of the other phones (voice dialing, camera, bluetooth). I was seriously considering the SE T610, but decided against it becuase it was not a flip phone. Also, I can't seem to get the infrared port working. I got my computer to detect it, but I was not able to send any images or files to it. I agree with earlier reviews that the ring tones are a bit annoying.

The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I would like it to go down a little farther on the front top and a little higher on the front bottom. It is a slim case that is durable for those who do not prefer the boxier ones or the two-piece ones.

 review/summary: Phone is great, T-mobile is the problem
 review/text: I love the phone, it is great. I upgraded to this phone because my old 3650 died. What I am not happy with is T-mobile service. I am most likely never going to try and watch a movie on that small screen but it is amazing what applications are availible for this phone. The display is large and ledgible, the keys are a little confusing but a great improvement over my old 3650.I have always been a Nokia customer, it is a shame that so much of the phones performance relies on the service provider.

 review/summary: Another Great Nokia Phone!!!
 review/text: I bought two of these phones - one for my wife and one for me. I signed up for the T-Mobile 1K + Nights and Weekends. First of all T-Mobile's people at customer service were great even the people who helped me port my old number over.The Phone is great!!! I found the signal and sound quality to be great, however, I found the menus to be a little counter-intuitive. Not as bad as Motorola, but not typical Nokia. The phone fits the hand well and works well in noisy areas. It uses the same charger that I used for for 252 back in 1998!!!

 review/summary: Good but S-L-O-W
 review/text: I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone. It's important that people know the following:First, the interface is slow. You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu. Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go. The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness. The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.

 review/summary: It works perfectly with my Blackjack II
 review/text: I have the Samsung Blackjack II and this bluetooth works perfectly for this phone. I ordered the bluetooth from Amazon about a year ago, and it still works like new. I am not sure what none-Sony phone the other reviewer has, but I can say that this bluetooth does work with my Samsung phone. The voice quality is excellent (I guess that's what Sony is good at - audio qualities) comparing to other bluetooths that I've tried. And it does filter out background noise relatively well. Compare to other models, the sound quality is definitely more stereo than monotone. The only thing I don't like about it is the ear hook so I don't use it. The bluetooth earpiece fits in my ear pretty securely so that's how I've been using it so far. I am thinking about getting a rubber plug to make it more tight-fitting.

 review/summary: I love IGo chargers
 review/text: IGo chargers are extremely versatile and have worked well. I have had several for at least 4 or 5 years and have never had one fail. What makes them great is their versatility. When my family all travels together, we can do so with one charger. I have what I refer to as my "techno bag" with all my tips, adapters, splitters, etc. inside. I have tips for each phone in our family and just swap tips as needed. I also like the fact that I can take it out of the car, replace the adapter and plug it into the wall. I use that often: for example, when I go to get my car worked on and am low on charge. I am buying the Igo Everywhere for each family for a stocking stuffer this year.

 review/text: Delivery time was long - at least a two-week calendar period. When the charger arrived, it LOOKED just like my original charger. However, on the underside of the plug-in to my cell phone, the unit had two small RAISED ridges (on my original plug-in had two small 'valleyed' ruts....not RAISED) Obviously, the plug-in did NOT go into my cell phone receptacle. I needed a different design for this plug-in to work. Still waiting for response from the OEM shop (through AMAZON). VERY FRUSTRATING!!

 review/summary: Great phone, but buy it elsewhere
 review/text: This is a wonderful phone. Great color screen, great external display, great reception, great camera, great look overall. It's full of memory to store pictures, wallpapers, screensavers, etc. It also has all the fun caller ID features and settings everyone wants. It comes with two addictive games (they drain the battery...don't play too long). The ringer is a little quiet and the vibrating is short and unnoticeable. My only real complaint is that the battery life is much, much, much shorter than advertised. However, I would strongly advise everyone to buy the phone from another company, not amazon.com. There are much better deals on the Internet, and I already regret buying from Amazon. You can find this phone for free on many other websites that are very reliable with FREE 2-day shipping (Amazon charged me a good $12 on top of the sales tax I had to pay). Though Amazon SAYS it includes a hands-free headset, it actually does NOT come with a headset. Cingular includes one Motorola travel charger; Amazon includes NO accessories. This phone deserves accessories (hands-free headset/case) and NEEDS a car charger. Order elsewhere and get them for free! One final tip. A lot of people complain about the battery meter. I agree that the battery reader displayed on the external screen is not very accurate. However, there is a more reliable measure inside the phone. (Settings-Phone level-battery meter)...click that to see where your battery REALLY is). Anyways, overall, this is the best phone for the money I've ever found. It's amazing that such a nice phone is free--buy it while you can!

 review/summary: Almost Worthless Piece of Junk
 review/text: I've had this model of phone for a little over six months and I am now on my FOURTH phone. The first one lasted about a month before the external display completely quit working. On the replacement phone they sent me (phone# 2) the keypad wouldn't light up at all. So, I immediately got a replacement sent to me (phone #3) and the keypad would only light up from time to time. It was able to make and receive calls so I decided to just put up with it. The phone worked well enough for about three months (a record for these phones I'm sure) and then it suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls. After I was able to convince Cingular that, yes, there was something wrong with my phone they sent me a replacement phone (phone #4) which I've had for about a month now. I just noticed yesterday that the external display is starting to not work from time to time. I'm sure that I'll be on phone# 5 within a few weeks.If there is any possible way you can avoid getting one of these phones, please do! They are absolute pieces of junk.

 review/summary: Tons of features, but still needs some work.
 review/text: Pros - Tons of features. You can download ring tones and pictures from your own computer with USB. The outside caller ID is also nice. The battery life is good and I have no complaints with the reception.Cons- The hinge is not as good as Samsung. The display is not as big as other phones. The default ring tones and games are horrible.I am very happy with the Motorola V220. I paid $50 for this phone and got features that usually cost 2 to 3 times more. I will start out with some background.I signed up for a family plan and I bought the V220 for myself and got a Samsung X427 for my wife. I am a gadget freak without a big budget. What sold me on the V220 was the USB port. I wanted to be able to make my own rings and transfer pictures without sending it to e-mail. This feature by far sets this phone apart from others. Motorola does not support the USB, but with a little research and Mobile Phone Tools it is possible to connect your phone to your PC with a mini-USB cable. The V220 also has a caller ID display on the outside. This is important because if you are in a meeting you don't have to open the phone to see who is calling.This phone also has voice dial which is cool. I believe it has speakerphone, but I have not used it. I also love how the menus and buttons are fully configurable. So you can setup your phone the way you like it. The screen is good and the battery life is much better than my old Sony-Ericcson T306, and I thought the T306 had decent battery life. I have never had a dropped call (after 2 months of ownership). The signal is strong with this phone, and I always had dropped calls with the Sony-Ericcson. I wanted to throw that phone out the window. The camera is also a nice feature for a phone in this price range.Now, the bad. The screen on my wife's Samsung is much better because it is bigger. Her phone is also a little smaller. I am disappointed with the default ring tones on the V220 and it doesn't come with a real game. My biggest complaint is the hinge. It creaks when you open it and doesn't feel near as solid as my wife's Samsung. However, the Samsung does not even have a caller ID display on the outside. The speaker on the V220 is not so good. When you make your own ring tones you have to be careful because the speaker cannot handle any bass or songs with a lot of instruments.When it comes down to it, this is a great phone for the money. This phone was perfect for me because I can do a lot with it. The Samsung was perfect for my wife because it is simple and elegant. The V220 has more gadgets. Motorola needs to work on the hinge design, but I would definitely buy this phone again in a heartbeat.

 review/summary: Multiple bad experiences
 review/text: After owning 2 Nokia phones for over 4 years and never having a problem with either of them, when my plan was up this time the Cingular rep recommended I go with the Motorola V220 due to the value and features. I have been nothing but disappointed. The first phone I got did not hold a charge, so I took it back within a few days and had it replaced. The second one had a distorted screen, so I replaced that one also. The third one had horrible reception and a crackling noise in the background, so I had that replaced. Finally the fourth one they gave me seemed to be fine...for about 2 months. Then the screen started fading in and out, and finally went black altogether. I never dropped it and always carried it in a padded case. Cingular replaced it with another V220 (now the 5th one in 2 months) and this one was also not working properly as it would not flip completely shut so phone calls would still be connected when it was shut and the battery was being worn down rapidly. FINALLY, they decided I had been through enough and they are sending me an upgraded V551. I am still not happy about this, though, because I don't have any faith in Motorola phones at this point. I'll have to see how the V551 is before I make a judgement, but I can tell you that the V220 is awful. It is very difficult to use and the users manual is worthless. I can't wait until my service contract is up so I can go with another provider and another phone.

I feel like it is the worst design on the planet! The manual does not explain how to operate it.

 review/summary: Better than the CS55
 review/text: I have been using the Plantronic's S11 for about 5 years now. It is wired but worked really well. The sound was perfect and I never had a complaint. Wanting to go wireless, I read reviews and felt the CS55 would fit my needs. I ordered it on Amazon and installed immediately upon receipt. My initial impressions were "so-so". It was a nice upgrade to be wireless but the headset did not sit firmly against my ear (using the over-the-head attachment), the sound was a bit "airy" - hollow-sounding. It definitely was not as good as my S11. I also heard my own breath often during calls. Whether it was from a sigh or just during the normal air release from talking...it was very annoying. I fiddled around with the controls for a long time and made about 35 calls to my wife to test (she was annoyed). I never got it correct and called Plantronics. They walked me through all the controls but still could not eliminate the 'wind' sound. I never once had the wind sound from my S11. So I returned the CS55.I then ordered the CS361N. I talk frequently to someone else with this headset and his voice is always clear. He raved about it. After plugging it in, I made my first call - to my wife again. No adjustments...and it was perfect! I could hear VERY clearly and the ear phones sit securely on my ears. I could bend over and move around and it did not feel like it was going to fall. My CS55 fell off several times during light movement behind my desk.I also know someone that recently bought the Jabra GN9125 and he sounds "airy" - or hollow.I wasn't sure I would like the stereo sound of having two ear pieces but it really is nice. My office is quiet so distractions are not an issue but it really forces me to focus. I'm sure I would also be happy with the Monoural CS361N.Hope this helps!

 review/text: I just replaced my second one of these. This second one never worked correctly but I didnt have time to take it in. It wasnt refurbished either. First off the OS needs to be upgraded but Hitachi is to cheap to authorize it. Let me tell you also that sprint is the worst cell company I've ever dealt with. (...) I wish I had time to go over all the problems with this phone. The only good thing about this thing if your interested is that everyone thinks your a star with this thing screw that I want something that last more than 2 months.

 review/text: Overall, a very nice headset, even though it's on the expensive side. At Best Buy it's $180. Incoming sound quality is excellent, and the headset stays on even w/o the ear clip. Volume is also good, except for really noisy environments. From what I've been told from the other end, the sound quality is decent but not greet; they can hear me fine except that there can be a lot of background noise. Pairing w/ my headset was easy--a couple button-presses and that was it. I paired the JX-10 with the RAZR from Cingular.

 review/text: I left feedback a few weeks back that said the battery was no better than the old battery I had. I didn't contact the OEM Shop to discuss it, and I figured I had simply wasted my time and money. Well, next thing I know, the OEM Shop is contacting me to ask what was wrong, and offered to replace the battery with another! These good people, with no initial action by me, wanted to make it right and make me a happy customer!Let me tell you: if you need anything that the OEM Shop sells, know that they are going to stand behind that product and do what they need to do to make sure you are a happy customer. They get high marks from me, and regardless how this new battery works - I've only had it a couple of days now, so I don't know if it is good or not, and I frankly don't care - I'm giving it and the OEM Shop high marks.Thanks very much for your service and support, OEM Shop! I'll be back!

 review/text: This item was defective. It took me hours upon hours in trying to contact you or GooDooDads for a replacement. No phone numbers or email addresses for either of you. I consider the lack of these to be Very Poor Customer Service. I finally was able to contact GoDooDads by utilizing your website BUT that was not customer friendly either. After contacting GoDooDads, I received a replacement battery on 1-20-2010. I hesitate to do business with you in the future due to not having a convenient way of contacting your Customer Service Dept when there is a problem with the product ordered through your company. I don't think I should be routed to a third party such as GoDooDads just because you ordered the item from them. I ordered and payed for the item through you and if I have a problem with it I expect you as the party I ordered it from to make it right. Do your non-computer literate customers a favor and provide us with 800 numbers or email addresses in which to address our dissatisfaction.Sincerely;Jon Jorgensen

 review/summary: Pretty much what I replaced
 review/text: The only reason I bought this product was to replace the battery in my phone that doesn't last very long. This battery does not work like new and doesn't last much longer than the one I replaced. I know it's cheap, but it was still kind of a waste of money.

 review/text: What can you say about a battery; it's just a battery until it doesn't charge. Ordered this battery for my husband's cell phone, but when it was received it seemed to be defective and wouldn't charge. I emailed OEM asking (but not expecting) a quick resolve. They sent me a replacement battery and didn't require I return the defective one. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE "OEM". BTW...the replacement battery works great!

 review/text: Product was shipped and is as described. This is the third battery I bought to put in my cell phone. The battery for this phone just doesn't last very long... lucky to get a whole year out of it. But for the price to replace the battery is pretty good and is a whole lot cheaper than to replace the whole phone. Shipping was fast too... all in all, I would buy this product again.

 review/summary: So Easy!
 review/text: This was one of the easiest batteries I've replaced! I thought it was going to be a challenge to get the case apart, but was accomplished in under a minute and from start to finish in under 5 minutes. Just pay attention to the internal configuration and put everything together the exact same way you took it apart. I have one of the older ipods that had the thicker case. I'm not sure I would be able to do it on my ipod touch though. I didn't use the tools that came with the battery, I found them ineffective, instead I used one of the dull blades in a pocket knife, the one that is a substitute for a file with a flat head screwdriver on the end. It worked perfect and not one scratch on my ipod. I am a woman in my 50's. If I can do it, anyone can!

 review/summary: Lenmar Battery for 5th Generation 30 GB (Video) iPod
 review/text: ** Firstly, make sure to find out your iPod's generation and model, so that you can order the proper battery for your iPod. For example, this Lenmar battery will not work for a Nano**My 5th Gen Video (30 GB) iPod battery died and could no longer hold its charge. Rather than paying for a repair I decided to replace the battery myself. I ordered the Lenmar battery, and it came as advertised, and works very well. The tools, while not the strongest of plastics, were helpful in removing the case, better than using one's nails. (The tools did not break, they merely deformed.)Warning: The case is not an easy thing to remove.If anyone else is going to attempt to replace their battery themselves, I suggest using these websites below. The first URL offers step-by-step instructions (with pictures). The second is a video that was also very helpful, especially in explaining how to remove the old battery, and how to install the new one. I suggest using both websites to avoid damaging your iPod.1)Type in a search engine: Installing iPod 5th Generation Battery at ifixit.com2)Search on youtube: 5th Generation ipod Installiation by OWCmacsalesBottom Line: With a little bit of hard work, fancy maneuvers, and patience, one can replace their battery in under an hour. The new Lenmar battery works very well and I can listen to my tunes once again. I would recommend it. Good luck.

 review/text: The phone is a really nice looking phone that I am glad to say I own mainly because no one else I know has it. I'm unable to give reviews on its processing speed venturing online since I do not use that feature very much where I am here in Europe but the main thing that breaks my heart about this phone is that it is not text friendly. Because of that I will have to get me another phone. The touch screen is great but the qwerty pad on the screen has very very tiny letters which slows down the process.Also the camera is very sensitive to movement while taking pictures but I'm pleased with video recording on it because I'm able to record videos on it up to 30 minutes if I wanted to. I would say it's a decent smart phone but my main reason for 3 stars is the qwerty on it. other than that I will continue to use this phone for other reasons.

 review/text: I like the product as I have to have it to be able to hear the other person -- I havea 12-year old Nokia cellphone and holding it up to my ear is useless... it has tohave an earbud... It does not get 5 stars because (while it works fine), the wire isso fragile that every 2-3 years it breaks and I have to reorder. in addition it will notstay in my ear as is, it has to have an adapter piece that I get from Radio Shack.But the sound quality that it does transmit is first class.

 review/summary: Better than expected
 review/text: This is a really nice case, feels like good leather. What I especially like about it is that there is a clear vinyl window that goes over the screen of the phone. This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up. What I'm not too sure about is the clip. It is really big, and I'm sorry I put it on cuz now I can't get it off. (otherwise it would be 5 stars) I am not one to clip my phone to anything, but it does make it easier to dig out of the bottom of my purse. Great deal at [...] bucks. I am extremely pleased

 review/summary: New Firmware. No more crashes! Great phone.
 review/text: Well, all I have read is true about this phone concerning infinite loops of resetting and crashing. It's all true. The reason for this rebooting of sorts was a memory allocation problem. If you loaded too many programs on the Palm and reached this "limit" the phone would loop forever becoming useless. When I first got it, I could only load 3 programs and it would be full. It was the dumbest display of memory allocation use I have ever seen. I mean, seriously, 3 programs and it was full. The same program in a different Palm device was 1/3 the size. Well, finally, they came out with a firmware update which made it all OK. The memory issues were solved, now I can load a ton of programs and still not fill my memory. It stopped crashing!!!! Yes, Versa Mail works!!! It also no longer crashes. I can now recommend this amazing phone without any reservations. The palm part of it is great. The phone is excellent, great reception, excellent bluetooth, etc. If you have no issues with the price, get it. I have no regrets. The competition is the iMate Jam which is windows.

 review/summary: Treo 650 Sucks!!!
 review/text: If you are considering buying a Treo 650 STOP! DON'T DO IT!!! Get a Sony Ericsson P910a.I was really lusting to have this phone. I viewed this phone as the ultimate in convergence of a PDA and a phone. However, when I started using the phone I found that it lacked many of the features of my T68i, which is a great phone.First, the software on the Treo 650 only allows incoming calls to be directed to the headset. When one makes an outgoing call you must dial the phone number then push the button on your headset to transfer the call. This is a major inconvenience when driving. I wrote to PalmOne about this and was told politely that this is the way their phone is designed to interact with a Bluetooth headset.Second, voice dialing is not an included feature. PalmOne endorses a third party voice dialing software that maxes out at 3000 contacts. Unfortunately, I have more than 3000 contacts in my PDA and I don't use voice dialing for all 3000. I only use voice dialing for about 40 contacts but this software is an all or nothing proposition. It doesn't allow the selection of specific contacts for voice dailing, which sucks. Although PalmOne does offer speed dialing on the Treo, it is a poor substitute for voice dialing, as I ran out of unique letters to assign to about 11 contacts.Third, the reception for this phone sucks. All places that my Sony Ericsson T68i works the Treo does not. In addition, the phone is very heavy compared to the Sony Ericsson 910a.I sold my Treo and replaced it with a Sony Ericsson P910a. The Sony Ericsson P910a is the upgrade I was searching for. It is my Sony Ericsson T68i with a PDA and camera.

 review/summary: Cell Phone Battery a real bargain
 review/text: My cell phone (Nokia)had an transmit life of about 5 minutes and then it would shut down. This happened even after a full charging cycle. I took it to AT&T. They offered me a new 2 year contract and a free phone. I asked what a new battery would cost and they said $42. Well, no way! I went on line and found the exact battery for about $10 including delivery. The battery came in a couple of days. It even had the Nokia holograph. I charged it, replaced the battery in my cell phone and Voil&agrave;, instant fix. (I also bought a $34 Motorola cell phone and am quite pleased). So now I have two working cell phones and I am one happy camper.

 review/text: All in All the battery works fine. One small problem, the battery is a little thicker than it should be. This leads me suspect that some one is selling slightly defective batteries. I have no proof of this except for my battery. This causes the back of the phone (cover) to not quite fit. The battery does charge & seems to work fine other than that. I hope this is just a problem with mine.

 review/text: I live in a metropolitan area with adequate cell coverage. My family owns 1 Motorola Q and 2 Motorola Razrs. We have no problems with the cell signal on the Razrs. The Q is frequently dropping calls and searching for a network in the same locations that the Razrs are showing 2 or 3 bars. I have to keep the Q plugged into the AC in order to keep the battery from draining due to the constant searching for a cell tower. I would not recommend the Q unless you live under a cell tower.

 review/text: The Cardo ScalaRider I purchased recently paired correctly with my new ZUMO 550 GPS. I have not been on the road with it yet (cold in the NE USA). The sound level seems a bit weak; I'll evaluate it with road & wind noise plus the hum of my VFR when the weather warms. It may require more careful ear speaker placement. The units battery loses charge rather quickly, so I suggest leaving it on the charger if you want to be ready to go at any time. I am also going to see if it will pair with a new bluetooth phone (Verizon FlipShot) when that arrives. I'll update when I have more info.

 review/summary: Great case for the price
 review/text: I'm using this case with the AT&T version of the Note. It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio. The material is soft and flexible, the cut-outs line up ok... not perfect, but they don't cause any functionality issues. I love the textured hand grips on the sides. The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push, but i prefer to have the covered over having them open, but recessed under the case. The s-pen opening is fine with my case, I have no problem getting it out. It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone, but there is a lot of area to cover on the note. It's not a perfect case, but I've paid $30 on cases for other "iDevices" that had similar issues. Boxwave shipped pretty quickly, but there was no tracking available.

 review/text: I have owned many phones over the years and a lot of expensive cases.This by far is the best case I have come across. It does not add any bulk to the phone and the pure comfort of holding it in the hand is speechless. The embossed sides , the nice rubbery feel gives good comfort and it's not a dust magnet.I only ordered this case because the the one that I had did not protect the corners of the phone when dropped. I will definitely keep this brand in mind in the future. It's that good and I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants good protection, comfort and style. Thank you BoxWave...

 review/text: I wanted a phone mainly for voice, and text messaging. I bought an unlocked phone so I didn't have to deal with any rigmarole at a phone store. I just slipped my SIM card in. I don't use the browser and I wasn't interested in a camera, which this phone doesn't have. The phone works very well. It seems to take several clicks to navigate around so perhaps that could be a bit more efficient (the reason for a 4 not a 5). The sound quality and reception are as good as they can be, battery life is fantastic compare to my older phone, and it is comfortable to use.

 review/summary: Is it supposed to work?
 review/text: My brother bought this headset for me a little over a month ago. At first I loved it. I ranted and raved about it, until the 30th day or so when it would not power up! I kept trying and trying, I figured maybe my outlet had a short or something. I didn't want to thinkn it was my new headset. It finally powers up and I am in love again! Well now, it continuously disconnects itself from my phone. I have to try connecting it again and I get "connection failed", I try it again and it connects just fine. The only problem now is that I can't hear anything once my call is connected. I am very disappointed and I am past my return time on the item. I don't recommend this item at all.It is lightweight and very compact also when it works, the clarity is excellent but that is a big WHEN.

 review/text: This headset from BB is the only one I found to work with the Pearl. It does works well and it' nice to be able to listen to music and have it pause to allow a phone call to be answered. Many times I don't have my Ipod with me and this is a good alternative. The quality of the sound is not as good as some better headsets but it's not bad either.

 review/summary: Good but not Great!
 review/text: This was the first of many bluetooth headsets I have tried for my Treo 650, this one had the best sound quality. No one had problems hearing me clearly. The only drawback was that I have problems keeping it in my ear. I tried to be creative,and put a Jabra jel earpiece from a previous headset over the earpiece, and this temporarily solved the problem, but the jel piece kept falling off. If they had something similar to this design, the headset would be perfect. Other headsets I have tried have been been horrible in sound quality. There is a Samsung model I tried that looks very similar to this one, and the quality is very good, but just like this model, it will not stay put in the ear. I hope they fix this problem soon.

 review/summary: overall really good
 review/text: I wasn't sure what I was getting when I found out that the cell phone battery for my phone could be purchased online for such a low price. I ended up getting this one, the 1400mAh one since it had a greater charge. It does hold a good charge and its very good. BUT.... The extra power has a disadvantage. It adds a distinctive "buttox" to the end of the cell phone that it didn't have before. It can't be put on the charger anymore with the battery on, it needs to be charged seperately- just something that I found to be important in the charging of it, i like to use my cell phone as an alarm or be able to get calls when its charging. As a solution, I use my old battery on it while the other battery is charging. For that reason I give it 4 stars, otherwise it would have gotten 5. If you don't mind the hump on its butt and the little charging inconvenience, I'd recommend it.

The range is excellent, and people on the other end say the quality is amazing. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the volume is a little low. I use this on a 2008 Mac Pro with Skype. Turning the volume in the application and on the headset all the way up, I wish sometimes that it would be a little louder. CS50 USB WIRELESS HEADSET FOR VOIP SOFTPHONES 200FT RANGE (CS50USB)

 review/summary: 700p is vastly better
 review/text: I own a Treo 700w and a 700p. The former was purchased before the latter was available, and I would happily give it away free, but not to a friend.I've been a Windows user for more than a dozen years, and have had multiple generations of Palm PDAs. The 700w ranks as the most troublesome.The 700w has all the problems you would expect in Windows software, plus a bunch of its own. Supposedly it's being pitched to the corporate market as Windows oriented, but it's botched for that purpose. ActiveSync is not reliable like HotSync. I spent a couple of days, with many rounds of email to tech support, before discovering why I could sync to Outlook at work, but not at home.There's a lot less software available for Windows Mobile than for PalmOS, and a lot of what is available doesn't work properly on the 700w because of its 240x240 screen. E.g., critical buttons wind up off-screen.The interface has some vague resemblance to Windows, but is actually quite different from the desktop version, so there's no benefit there. I guess you could say it's "Windows-like" in that it's riddled with inconsistencies and "clevernesses" that you sort of have to discover on your own. (E.g., to see a list of running applications, press and hold the OK button.)Several applications that apparently had nothing to do with Internet Explorer (e.g., Webster's Dictionary) nevertheless broke IE when installed, and had to be discarded (and then I had to do a hard reset on the 700w).The standard sync software does not back up applications and settings, so I had to manually restore them every time I had to do a hard reset, which was much too often. Verizon implicitly recognized this as a problem, and in their first software upgrade included an application, Sprite, that does a pretty good job of backup--separate from sync'ing.The 700w used about 30MB of memory for a set of applications that consumes only 10MB on the 700p, and memory usage was always pretty much unpredictable on the 700w, although I never actually ran out.Having multiple active applications (even though only one could have the screen at any time) turned out to be more of a bother than an advantage.I could go on and on. I figure I invested more than 80 hours trying to make a go of using the 700w before finally giving up. I do have a couple of nice things to say about it: It comes with a game--Bubble Breaker--pre-installed that I found to be more addictive than anything on a Palm, and KSE Backgammon is the strongest computer backgammon player I've tried.The 700p just works. I've had a whole series of Palms, and in my experience they don't embroil you in software problems. My problem has been dropping them and breaking their screens.On both phones, integration between Contacts and the phone is excellent. In addition to Speed Dial, you can pull up most contacts with two or three letters of the name, and then dial with a single button press.The cameras on both are pretty good (1.3 megapixel) in adequate light, but have no flash. Interface and zoom are a little easier on the 700p.

This phone held a charge for almost two days with me CONSTANTLY using it. So that is great. If I don't mess with it it lasts at least 3 days. The internet is FAST and the speakers for the music are very impressive for a little cell phone. I love it, and I must say I did a great job of picking my new phone :) I don't think you will be sorry.

 review/summary: Best Phone Yet !!!
 review/text: I recently purchased this phone as an upgrade from my i95cl. This is a great phone. I've heard some people say on other review boards that it is big and bulky. I think they were writing about the WRONG phone.This phone is thin and lightweight (esp. compared to i95). Clarity is EXCELLENT. My calls sound like a landline phone and it is so great. The menus are easy to navigate.The only con I have about the phone is the rubber piece that covers the charger hole. Sometimes it is hard to open, especially when you need to access it quickly to plug your phone in. I'm sure after a couple of weeks I will get the hang of it and it will loosen up a bit to make it easier to open as well.This is a great phone and I'd recommend it to anyone! I'm so glad I upgraded. I just can't say enough good things about this phone and it's too many to mention.

 review/text: I switched back to nextel from cingular wireless last week, and I got this phone with my new contract. I love it! It has a crisp, clear screen, with a good external caller ID screen. The battery life isn't too bad, but it would probably be a good idea to get a vehicle charger. I get great reception where I live and where I go to school, and so far I have been very happy that I switched. The camera on the phone is pretty good, nothing to complain about there, and it also has a 4x zoom which is really cool. Overall, I am really satisfied with my phone and the service. If you are thinking about switching to nextel, or are thinking about purchasing this phone, I think it is a great purchase!

 review/summary: Reliable, cheap phone-and only a phone
 review/text: Simple, well built, excellent battery life; the 6010 is a great phone-and that's all it is.There's no easy way to move information/addresses to the phone-no bluetooth, no included cable. There are 3rd party cable's available.The keyboard is large and is great for dialing in the middle of the night (like I do). I think it has one of the largest number keypad's of any phone.I've dropped this phone numerous times, and it hasn't had any problems.If you only want a mobile phone with nothing else, this is a good choice.

 review/summary: It works
 review/text: The adapter works. I purchased for W580i. Charger works fine. One problem I have is, the light is too bright and it bothers while driving if it is directed at your face. Personally, I think the light is unnecessary with this charger.

 review/summary: Great idea!
 review/text: This car phone charger is great... it works just as it should, but it also has a little flashlight on it! The light is powerful enough to light up the car at night, but mild enough not to blind the driver. I love it!

 review/summary: Don't purchase if you don't have a USB wall charger!
 review/text: I purchased this item thinking I would be able to use my iPod's wall charger to charge the external battery. WRONG! The cable included only works with a USB charging device (ie. computer, some iPod chargers, the special JAVOedge charger that does not come included with the battery). I ended up having to purchase another iPod charger with a USB port as I wasn't planning on taking my hefty laptop to Europe just to change my new external battery. If you already have a USB wall charger, or you're planning on charging the item just from your computer, it will work for you. Also, be aware that the the charge time for the battery is SIX hours (as listed on JAVOedge's website). The item did not come with any sort of instruction manual for charging or usage, and I had to look up product information on the company's website. I was planning on returning the item all together, but JAVOedge's return policy is so horrible that I decided to just keep it and buy the USB wall charger from a different company just so I didn't have to pay the extra shipping fee to send the battery back to the company. I would recommend going with a different product if for no other reason then to not have to deal with this company!

 review/summary: Great product
 review/text: Almost as good as using my finger. I have not been able to find a better stylus yet, and I have had the opportunity to try a bunch of them. Only complaint is the clip that inserts into the music jack on the iPad rattles a lot, but that's an easy fix; just take it off. It's very light, comfortable to hold, and very accurate for what I do ( typing, drawing, general navigating). I would absolutely recommend this for anyone looking for a good stylus.
